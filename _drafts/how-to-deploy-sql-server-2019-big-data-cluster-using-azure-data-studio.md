For you who follows my sporadic articles you wonder why I have yeat another post, (YAP), covering how to deploy a **SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster**, (BDC), using **Azure Data Studio**, (ADS).

The answer to that is that the version of BDC I deployed was a pre-release, and since then BDC has gone GA, (General Avalilability), and there are certain differences in ddeployment process between RC1, and RTM.

So in this post let us look at how to deploy BDC RTM to Azure Kubernetes Service using ADS.
