Back in the day I wrote quite a few blog posts about [**SQL Server Machine Learning Services**][1] as well as [**SQL Server Extensibility Framework**][2], and [**External Languages**][2].

In September 2020, Microsoft announced that they have open-sourced the technology behind SQL Server Extensibility Framework, and this blog post gives an overview of how it works. Future posts will drill down in more detail around it.
