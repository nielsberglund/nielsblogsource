                             Rtools 3.5

This bundle contains the Windows Toolchain and Build Utilities for R.
The original collection was put together by Prof. Brian Ripley and 
Duncan Murdoch; it is currently maintained by Jeroen Ooms.

                           BUILD UTILITIES

Rtools includes some standard utilities such as make, bash, sed, which 
are required to build R packages with compiled code. These utilities
need to be on the PATH when installing R packages from source. 

You can either modify your Windows system PATH, or instead define a line 
like below in your ".Renviron" file in your Documents folder. See also
the manual page for ?Startup in R for saving variables.

    PATH="C:\Rtools\bin;${PATH}"

Note that Windows PATH uses backslashes. You can skip this step if your
PATH already has working make and sh, for example from CYGWIN or msys2.
However you should not put other toolchains (gcc, g++, ld) on the PATH.


                             GCC TOOLCHAIN

Versions 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 of Rtools ship with a mingw-w64 toolchain 
based on gcc 4.9.3. We do not use multilib compilers, instead we ship 
separate compilers targeting 32 and 64 bit.

By default, R looks for compilers in the default installation path in
C:\Rtools\. If you install Rtools anywhere else, you have to point R 
to the path of gcc, g++, ld, by setting a variable called BINPREF.
For example:

    BINPREF="M:/R/Rtools-3.5/mingw_$(WIN)/bin/"

Note how we embed another variable $(WIN) which is set by R to either 
"32" or "64" depending on the target. Thereby this BINPREF works for 
both architectures. Also note that R requires forward slashes here.

You can either store this variable in your Windows system or define it
in your ".Renviron" file in the user home (Documents) folder. See also
the manual page for ?Startup in R.
