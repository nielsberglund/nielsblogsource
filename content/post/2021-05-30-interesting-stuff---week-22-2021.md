Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth that has to do with things that interest me:

* AI/data science
* data in general
* data architecture
* streaming
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.

# Machine Learning / AI

* [From conversation to code: Microsoft introduces its first product features powered by GPT-3][2]. Back in September 2020, Microsoft announced it had [exclusively licensed GPT-3][1] -  the autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. The linked-to post discusses the first incarnation of GPT-3 in Microsoft's Power Apps. Very, very interesting!
* [Introducing Databricks Machine Learning: a Data-native, Collaborative, Full ML Lifecycle Solution][4]. The [**Data + AI Summit 2021**][3] took place the week just gone by. The post I linked to talks about one of the announcements made during the summit; the launch of **Databricks Machine Learning**, an enterprise ML solution that is data-native, collaborative, and supports the entire ML lifecycle. I am pretty "chuffed" to see how the solution includes, among other things, a feature store!

## Streaming

* [Engaging Database Partials with Apache Kafka for Distributed System Consistency ft. Pat Helland][5]. When using various data from different systems, for example, for reports, obtaining the correct data when you need it in real-time can be difficult. In this videoed podcast, Pat Helland - (Principal Architect, Salesforce) - explains how to make educated partial answers when you need to use the Apache KafkaÂ® platform.

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

**Figure 1:** *Big Data & Analytics*

As mentioned in previous roundups, I deliver an Analytics on SQL Server Big Data Cluster training class at the [**2021 Data Platform Summit**][7]! So right now, I am creating content for the course. I am so looking forward to it!

If you are interested, [sign up][5] for the class. When signing up, you also get free access to the Summit! Hope to see you there!

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. Please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me if you have ideas for what to cover.
