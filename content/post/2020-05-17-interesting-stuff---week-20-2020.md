Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Distributed Computing

* [Advanced Distributed Systems Design (Online Course)][1]. Udi Dahan is one of the world's foremost experts on Service-Oriented Architecture, Distributed Systems and Domain-Driven Design. Enrol for free and learn all about distributed systems design. Usually, this course costs $2,500, but now - due to the pandemic - it is free! Udi is an excellent instructor, and as one of my colleagues said: *as apposed to other so-called experts, there is none of this "tear down, and build up" bullsh%t.*
* [Decomposing a Monolith Does Not Require Microservices - Sam Newman at QCon London][2]. This is an [InfoQ][iq] article based on a presentation by Sam Newman at QCon in London, where he discussed breaking down monoliths. 
* [Paxos consensus for beginners][3]. The post here tries to explain Paxos. Paxos is a consensus algorithm, and most other consensus algorithms, such as Raft, ZAB, etc., are based on Paxos. So I said that the post tries to explain Paxos, and in my mind, the author succeeds! 

## Streaming

* [Resiliency and Disaster Recovery with Kafka][4]. The post linked to here presents possible solutions for running a multi-region Kafka setup. I really liked the post as it gave some solutions to issues we have at [Derivco](/derivco) right now.
* [Building a Telegram Bot Powered by Apache Kafka and ksqlDB][5]. This post does exactly what the title says: [Robin Moffat][rmoff], (Mr Kafka), shows us how to use Kafka and ksqlDB together to build an awesome app! Very cool usage of ksqlDB!
* [Learn how to use Kafkacat â€” the most versatile Kafka CLI client][6]. `kafkacat` is a command-line tool for producing and consuming Kafka messages, (and more), and in the post, the author talks us through how easy it is to use.
* [Announcing ksqlDB 0.9.0][7]. As the title says; the post announces ksqlDB 0.9, and looks at some new features. I am quite interested in the multi-join support! That will come in quite handy for [us](/derivco).
* [Apache Kafka Needs No Keeper: Removing the Apache ZooKeeper Dependency][8]. This post outlines the work done to remove the ZooKeeper dependency from Kafka.

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

Still in lock-down! It is now coming up to two months, and I do not see any end in sight. The only positive is that the restrictions on online commerce have been lifted, so I managed to get me a [Corsair K95 RGB PLATINUM XT][9] keyboard. I like it!

I wrote in one the [Interesting Stuff - Week 17, 2020][10] post about how Microsoft has open-sourced the SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework, and I am working together with a couple of other MVPs and Microsoft developer on a .NET extension. Watch this space!

I am also working on the follow-up to the [A Lap Around SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster: Background & Technology][11] post. The upcoming post looks at the architecture. So when will it be published you may ask? I have learnt from my mistakes, so at this stage, I have no idea.

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
