This week's AI reading list had everything from creative game development powered by vibe coding to deep dives into AI agents and the new Model Context Protocol (MCP). I explore the tools and ideas shaping the next wave of intelligent, collaborative systems. 

Oh, and speaking of agents ‚Äì the Call for Speakers is now open for our next event: [**Data & AI Community Day Durban: Season of AI ‚Äì The Age of Agency**][4]. If you're into AI Agents, Generative AI, or just want to vibe with the community, this one's for you.

## Generative AI

* [Vibe Coding Journey Part 1: Building Lorye Go! with AI][1]. This is the first part of a "**vibe coding**" journey blog post series detailing the creation of a game called "Lorye Go! Hong Kong Edition" using AI. The author, Entz Yeung, a data scientist and AI engineer, describes his initial foray into game development, leveraging AI tools to bring his imaginative board game concept to life. The piece highlights the synergy between human creativity and artificial intelligence in the development process, touching on the challenges and surprising capabilities encountered while building the game from scratch.
* [Model Context Protocol (MCP): Unlocking the Full Potential of LLMs][2]. This blog post introduces the **Model Context Protocol** (MCP) as a solution to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The author argues that MCP is designed to streamline integrations, increase flexibility in choosing LLM providers, and ensure data security when building AI workflows. By offering pre-built integrations and the ability to easily switch between different LLM vendors, MCP aims to simplify development and future-proof systems. Ultimately, the protocol intends to help developers unlock the full potential of LLMs by making their use more efficient, adaptable, and secure across various applications.
* [Agentic AI: Single vs Multi-Agent Systems][3]. This Towards Data Science post dives into agentic AI, specifically comparing single-agent versus multi-agent systems and their construction using tools like LangGraph. The author explores how to build automated workflows driven by large language models, highlighting multi-agent architectures' increased flexibility and collaborative potential. Through practical examples of summarisation and information gathering, the piece aims to guide readers in understanding the architectural differences and trade-offs involved in developing sophisticated AI agents for various data-driven tasks.

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

After the roaring success of [**Data & AI Community Day Durban: Season of AI ‚Äì AI @ Ignite++**][5], I've just about caught my breath and maybe a few hours of sleep (apparently, sleep is optional when the community is this good). The event was a smashing hit with over 200 attendees, a mountain of technical content, and only a few minor AV hiccups (classic!). Massive thanks to everyone who came, spoke, or bravely asked, "Is this thing on?" into a live mic. So, what now:

I'm super excited to announce that the Call for Speakers is now OPEN for our next adventure: üé§ [**Data & AI Community Day Durban: Season of AI ‚Äì The Age of Agency**][4] üß†ü§ñ, on May 24.

As the name suggests, this one's theme is about AI Agents ‚Äì what they are, how they learn, adapt, collaborate, and occasionally surprise us with behaviour that's a little too smart for comfort. If you've been tinkering with **Model Context Protocol** (MCP) or building agent frameworks that feel like mini digital startups, we want to hear from you. Throw in some **Vibe Coding**, a dash of AI-assisted development, and a side of "What just happened?" and you've got our kind of session.

But don't worry ‚Äì it's not all Agents all the time. We're still all-in on the broader Data & AI universe:

* üí¨ Generative AI & LLMs
* üìä Power Platform & Microsoft Fabric
* üõ¢Ô∏è Database Development (our first love)
* üß† Data Science & Machine Learning
* üì° Streaming, Real-Time Analytics, and everything in between

If it's smart, data-driven, slightly futuristic, and gets the neurons firing, it's fair game:

####  **Event Details**

* üìÜ Date: Satuday, May 24, 2025
* üè® Venue: To be confirmed.
