Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Misc.

* [Feature Toggles: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly][1]. An [InfoQ][iq] presentation where the presenter covers how to use feature toggles effectively, some of the horror stories and how to avoid them, and how to deal with them if they do occur.

## Machine Learning

* [Flink for online Machine Learning and real-time processing at Weibo][2]. This post looks at the architecture of Weibo's Machine Learning platform and how they use Apache Flink to develop their real-time Machine Learning pipelines. I found this post very interesting!

## Azure Data Studio

* [SQL Server Assessment Extension for Azure Data Studio][3]. This is very cool! An extension to Azure Data Studio which provides a user interface for evaluating SQL Server instances and databases for best practices.

## Streaming

* [The Cost of Apache Kafka: An Engineerâ€™s Guide to Pricing Out DIY Operations][4]. This is a very interesting post, looking at costings of running Kafka. It definitely provides food for thought.

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

In last weeks roundup, I mentioned about the second **The Azure Sketches, Architect Series** webinar, and how we should run it on Wednesday, June 17. Well, that didn't happen so we run it this coming Tuesday, (June 23), instead. Sign up [here][6] if you are interested.

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
