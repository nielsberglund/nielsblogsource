Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, etc., that has to do with things that interest me

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This is the "roundup" of the posts that has been most interesting to me, for the week just gone by. 

<!--more-->

For one reason or another, there has been very little catching my eye this week, but here goes.

## SQL Server

* [SQL Server - estimates outside of the histogram - half-baked draft][1]. [Lonny][2] has a start of a series about cardinality estimates outside of the stats histogram. It looks very, very interesting!

## Data Science

* [TFX: A TensorFlow-based production scale machine learning platform][3]. Adrian at [the morning paper][mp] dissects a white paper about a machine learning platform targeted at TensorFlow.
* [Create Powerpoint presentations from R with the OfficeR package][4]. A blog post from the guys at [Revolution Analytics][re] about the [OfficeR][5] package, which enables you to take a Word or PowerPoint template and programmatically insert text, tables and charts generated by R into the template to create a complete document. Very cool!!

## SQL Server 2016 R Services

Yes, I know, I know - I have not published anything for quite a while in the SQL Server R Services series. As mentioned in a couple of previous roundups, I had planned to have **Internals - XI** out by now, but obviously it is not. Main reason is that I have been lazy, and also that "the muse" has been apparent by her absence. The (somewhat) good news is that I have at least made some progress with **Internals - XI**. 

If you want to re-acquaint you with the series, the published "episodes" are as follows:

1. [Microsoft SQL Server 2016 R Services Installation][sinst]
1. [Microsoft SQL Server R Services - Internals I][si1]
1. [Microsoft SQL Server R Services - Internals II][si2]
1. [Microsoft SQL Server R Services - Internals III][si3]
1. [Microsoft SQL Server R Services - Internals IV][si4]
1. [Microsoft SQL Server R Services - Internals V][si5]
1. [Microsoft SQL Server R Services - Internals VI] [si6]
1. [Microsoft SQL Server R Services - Internals VII][si7]
1. [Microsoft SQL Server R Services - Internals VIII][si8]
1. [Microsoft SQL Server R Services - Internals IX][si9]
1. [Microsoft SQL Server R Services - Internals X][si10]

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
