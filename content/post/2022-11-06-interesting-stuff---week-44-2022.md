Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth that has to do with things that interest me:

* AI/data science
* data in general
* data architecture
* streaming
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.

## AI/ML

* [How Pinterest Leverages Realtime User Actions in Recommendation to Boost Homefeed Engagement Volume][1]. In the [roundup][2] for last week, I looked at an interesting post by Pinterest, looking at how they make Pin recommendations. This post goes further and looks at real-time actions by users and how that leads to better engagement.

## Streaming

* [Building Real-Time ETL Pipelines with Apache Kafka][3]. This post provides an introduction to building real-time ETL pipelines with Apache Kafka, Apache Kafka Connect, and Apache Kafka Streams. Quite interesting!

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

It has probably not gone unnoticed how Elon Musk has bought Twitter and the "saga" following the purchase. Related to that, quite a few people are looking for alternatives to Twitter, and the choice for many seems to be [Mastodon][4]. Since I am a "sucker# for trying new stuff (not that Mastodon is new - it was introduced in 2016), I just signed up. My "handle" is **@nielsb@fosstodon.org**, and the link to my profile is [here][5].

So, what else is new? Well, I am making my first USA trip since 2009, and I am speaking at the [**PASS Data Community Summit 2022**][6]. My session is:

* **ksqlDB - The Real-Time Streaming Database**. As the title implies, the presentation is about **ksqlDB**. I have delivered ksqlDB talks before, but this session is very much new material.

I am excited! If you are around, come by and say Hi!

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. Please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me if you have ideas for what to cover.
