Get ready for an exciting week in the world of data streaming! In this week's blog, we'll dive into the highlights from the recent Current 2023 conference, including the buzzworthy Confluent Cloud-Flink integration. Plus, we'll explore the game-changing addition of Apache Flink on Confluent Cloud and Confluent's new initiative, **Data Streaming for AI** 

Finally, let's rewind to my recent adventure at Data Saturday Cape Town, and get a sneak peek at the upcoming **AI/ML & Data Infusion Roadshow Durban** event. Stay tuned for some thrilling updates! ðŸš€

## Streaming

* [Kafka, Flink, and Beyond! Here's What Happened at Current 2023][1]. The Confluent conference **Current | The Next Generation of Kafka Summit** was held the week just gone by in San Jose, CA. The link is to a recap of the event, and for me, the most exciting part is the Confluent Cloud-Flink integration (see more below). Sure, there are more interesting things, but the Kafka-Flink integration stands out for me.
* [Introducing Apache Flink on Confluent Cloud][2]. This is the most exciting thing I have seen in a long time (see above :smile:). I have been waiting for this for a long time. I have been using Kafka for a while now, and I have "dabbled" with Flink. However, having to manage both Kafka and Flink has always made me shy away from going all in. So what this blog-post discusses is music to my ear: being able to run Apache Flink on Confluent Cloud! I am so looking forward to trying this out.
* [Your AI Data Problems Just Got Easier with Data Streaming for AI][3]. This blog-post looks at Confluent's newly announced initiative: **Data Streaming for AI**. The initiative aims to help customers build AI applications that leverage real-time, fresh, and reliable data from various sources. Part of the initiative is Confluent expanding its ecosystem to include critical AI technologies and committing to a product enhancements roadmap to help build AI apps faster. The initiative has plans for fully managed connectors for the modern AI stack, GenAI API calls built into Apache Flink, and an AI Assistant to help build faster on Confluent.

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

As I wrote in the previous roundup, this weekend, I was in Cape Town for **Data Saturday Cape Town**:

I had a great time, and I want to thank the organizers for putting together a great event. I also want to thank the attendees for coming to my sessions. I hope you enjoyed it and learned something new. If you want the slide decks and the code, please [ping][ma].

With Data Saturday Cape Town out of the way, it is time to concentrate on the upcoming [**AI/ML & Data Infusion Roadshow Durban**][4] event. As I have posted before, this is the follow-up event from **Data Saturday Durban** back in August. The event is on the 11th of November, and it is free. Both call for [speakers][5] (CfS), as well as [registration][6], is open. Hurry up to register, and if you want to present a topic, submit the proposal before we close the CfS. Looking at the presentation topics submitted so far, we are in for a treat!

I look forward to this event and hope to see you there!

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. Please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me if you have ideas for what to cover.
