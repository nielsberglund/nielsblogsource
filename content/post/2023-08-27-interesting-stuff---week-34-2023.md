## AI/ML

* [Dynamic Pricing with Reinforcement Learning from Scratch: Q-Learning][1]. This blog post introduces the concept of Reinforcement Learning (RL), a machine learning technique where an agent learns to achieve a goal by trial and error. The article focuses on Q-Learning, a value-based method that uses a table of Q-values to estimate the expected reward of taking an action in a state. The blog post provides a practical Python example of applying Q-Learning to a Dynamic Pricing problem, where an agent learns to adjust prices over time to maximize profit. It also discusses the limitations and challenges of the example and some references for further learning.
* [Machine Learning vs. AI vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks: What's the Difference?][2]. The article explains the differences between machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and neural networks. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms and data to learn from experience and improve performance. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to learn from large amounts of data and perform complex tasks. Neural networks are computational models that mimic the structure and function of biological neurons. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process and transmit information. The article also provides some examples and applications of these concepts, such as image recognition, natural language processing, self-driving cars, and chatbots.

## GenerativeAI

* [Toward AGI ‚Äî What is Missing?][3]. This article discusses the challenges and opportunities of developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a system that can perform any intellectual task humans can. The article argues that current AI systems are limited by their narrow focus, lack of common sense, and inability to learn from a few examples. In addition, the article suggests some possible ways to overcome these limitations, such as integrating symbolic and sub-symbolic methods, building causal models, and leveraging human knowledge and feedback. The article concludes that AGI is a long-term goal that requires interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical considerations, and continuous innovation.
* [ChatGPT Killed the Old AI. Now Everyone Is Rushing to Build a New One][4]. This blog post discusses the impact of ChatGPT, a new AI model that can generate realistic and engaging conversations. The post claims that ChatGPT has killed the old AI that relied on rules and logic and has opened up new possibilities for human-AI interaction. It explores some of the challenges and opportunities of ChatGPT, such as its ethical implications, potential applications, and limitations. The blog post concludes that ChatGPT is a revolutionary technology that will change how we communicate, learn, and entertain ourselves.

## Streaming

* [The Streaming Plane][5]. This blog post by [Hubert][hubert] describes the concept of the data divide, which is the distinction between the operational and analytical data planes. In the post, [Hubert][hubert] introduces the streaming plane, a bridge between the two planes that enables real-time analytics with historical context. The post explains the streaming plane's characteristics, challenges, opportunities, and how it can serve as a Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) or real-time streaming data mesh. In addition, the post also provides some examples of systems and technologies that belong to the streaming plane.
* [Life Happens in Real Time, Not in Batches: The Business Value of Real-Time Streaming][6]. This blog post discusses the importance and benefits of data streaming for modern businesses that need to process and analyze large amounts of real-time data. The post looks at the challenges and opportunities of data streaming, such as its complexity, scalability, reliability, security, and compliance. The post recommends using managed services for data streaming, such as Confluent Cloud, to simplify and accelerate the adoption and deployment of streaming solutions1. Finally, the post provides examples and use cases of data streaming across different industries, such as retail, banking, manufacturing, and transportation.
