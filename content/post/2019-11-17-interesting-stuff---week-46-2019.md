Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## .NET

* [Building Modern Cloud Applications using Pulumi and .NET Core][1]. As you probably know, [Pulumi][2] is an open source infrastructure as code tool which makes it easy to create, deploy, and manage cloud applications, using your favorite development languages. The post I link to announces .NET Core support for Pulumi.

## Data Science / Machine Learning

* [Azure AI and Machine Learning talk series][3]. This is a post by [David][revod], where lists the talks he and his team did at Microsoft Ignite. These talks are also presented worldwide at [**Microsoft Ignite The Tour**][4] during the next six months.  

## SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster

* [Build an intelligent analytics platform with SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters][6]. This post gives a high-level view of one can create a powerful analytics platform on top of SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster.

## Microsoft Ignite The Tour

* [Microsoft Ignite The Tour Johannesburg][5]. I mentioned **Microsoft Ignite the Tour** above, and this is for my readers in South Africa. **Microsoft Ignite the Tour** visits Johannesburg, January 30 - 31, 2020, so register now to not miss out on the latest in cloud technologies and developer tools. Oh, and by the way, I deliver three talks in Johannesburg:

    * **A Lap Around SQL Server Big Data Cluster**.
    * **Improve Customer Lifetime Value using Azure Databricks & Delta Lake**.
    * **Simplify and Scale Your Data Pipelines with Azure Delta Lake**.

So [register][5] now, and come and say Hi!

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
