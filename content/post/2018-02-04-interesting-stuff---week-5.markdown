Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## SQL Server

* [JSON in SQL Server â€“ Use cases][1]. I had a link to a post by [Jovan][jovpop] in last week's [roundup][int4], where he wrote about using JSON for de-normalised data models. In this post, Jovan discusses various use cases for JSON in SQL Server. Interesting!
* [How It Works: SQL Server DTC (MSDTC and XA Transactions)][2]. An in-depth post about how MS DTC and the XA protocol works in SQL Server.
* [Simplify REST API development for modern Single-page apps with SQL Server][4]. More from ["Mr JSON in SQL Server"][jovpop] (Jovan). In this post, he writes about how the use of JSON in SQL Server can simplify REST API development.

## Databases Misc.

* [Why and How Database Changes Should Be Included in the Deployment Pipeline][3]. What the title says. An article from [InfoQ][iq] about including database code in the build pipeline.

## .NET

* [.NET Core 2.1 Roadmap][5]. This post lays out the roadmap for the upcoming .NET Core 2.1, and it focuses on CoreCLR, CoreFX and CLI improvements.
* [C# - All About Span: Exploring a New .NET Mainstay][6]. The above link led me to this article by [Stephen Toub][7] where he discusses a new value type in .NET: `System.Span<T>`. The article is a **must read**.

## Streaming

* [KSQL January release: Streaming SQL for Apache Kafka][8]. This post announces the release of KSQL 0.4, aka the January 2018 release of KSQL, and it takes a look at what is new in this release.

## Data Science

* [Randomness in Deep Learning Systems: Monte Carlo and Las Vegas Methods][9]. A short and sweet comparison between Las Vegas and Monte Carlo methods by [Jesus][jesrod].
* [R or Python? Python or R? The ongoing debate.][10]. Some thoughts by [Tomaz][tomaz] about R vs. Python for data scientists.

## SQL Server R Services

* [Microsoft SQL Server R Services - Internals XX][si20]. This post is the last post of the **Internals** posts in the **Microsoft SQL Server R Services** series. In the post, I cover how SQL Server, and the launchpad service, handle errors from the external engine.

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
