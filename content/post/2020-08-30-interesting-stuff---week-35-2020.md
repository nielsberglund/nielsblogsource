Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## SQL Server

* [What is Azure SQL Edge | Data Exposed][1]. This is part one of a three-part video series about Azure SQL Edge. In this part, we get an introduction to Azure SQL Edge and its features.

## Streaming

* [Enabling Spark SQL DDL and DML in Delta Lake on Apache Spark 3.0][2]. This post, and video, discuss some of the cool new features in Delta Lake 0.7.0. There are quite a lot of new exciting things in that release!
* [Best of Kafka Summit 2020 Roundup][3]. So, The Kafka Summit took place August 24 - 25, (virtually), and I managed to attend quite a few sessions. The post linked to here lists some of the "must-see" sessions. For me, the best session was the keynote the second day by Jay Kreps and Sam Newman. It was awesome!
* [Streaming SQL Cheat Sheet for Apache Kafka][4]. As the title says, link to a cheat sheet for ksqlDB syntax. I have downloaded the cheat sheet and have it on my desktop so that I can access it easy!
* [Mastering Kafka Streams and ksqlDB][5]. The book in the post linked to here promises to be the "go-to" book for anything KStreams/ksqlDB related. I'll make sure my developers get some copies!

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
