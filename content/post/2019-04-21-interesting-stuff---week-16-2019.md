Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## .NET

* [Announcing .NET Core 3 Preview 4][1]. Some new interesting features in Preview 4 of .NET Core 3.0. Hope we'll see RTM soon.

## Distributed Computing

* [Learn Enough Docker to be Useful Part 1: The Conceptual Landscape][2]. This post is the first "episode" in a series about how to learn Docker. It is excellent, and for a Docker newbie as myself quite invaluable!
* [Key Kubernetes Concepts][3]. This article covers essential Kubernetes concepts, and itâ€™ll help you make a mental model of the most important Kubernetes terms to speed your understanding of the technology.
* [Data Lake: an asset or a liability?][4]. This post looks at several important points to take into account when starting a Data Lake project. 

## SQL Server

* [The April release of Azure Data Studio is now available][5]. As the title says; Microsoft has released a new version (April 2019) of Azure Data Studio. There are quite a few new interesting features, and I cannot wait to try out the [SandDance][6] extension.

## Data Science

* [How to create your own Deep Learning Project in Azure][7]. In this article, the author takes us through how to use Azure Databricks with Tensorflow and Keras to build a deep learning project. 
* [Automated machine learning from SQL Server with Azure Machine Learning][8]. This post discusses how to leverage Azure Machine Learning Service from SQL Server Machine Learning Services.

## Streaming

* [Kafka Summit New York 2019 Session Videos][9]. The Kafka Summit took place in New York earlier this month. This post links to the session videos. 
* [Dawn of DevOps: Managing and Evolving Schemas with Confluent Control Center][10]. This post is the first in a three-part series of DevOps related "stuff". This first post looks at how to use Confluence Control Center to manage and evolve schemas.
* [Beat Cache Invalidation in ASP.NET Core Using Kafka and Debezium][11]. This article discusses how to create a better in-memory cache in ASP.NET Core by using Change Data Capture on a database to send events to Apache Kafka via Debezium.
* [Pivoting Aggregates in Ksql][12]. This is an excellent post by [Robin][rmoff] where he show how we can do pivoting of aggregates in KSQL.

## SQL Server Machine Learning Services

* [Installing R Packages in SQL Server Machine Learning Services - IV: Permissions][pkg4]. In this post, I look at permissions required when using `CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY` as well as ownership of the created libraries.

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
