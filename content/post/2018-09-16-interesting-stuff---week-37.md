Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## SQL Server

* [SQL Server Execution Plans, 3rd Edition][1]. The third edition of [Grant Fritchey's][grantf] excellent book about SQL Server Query Plans. If you are a developer or a DBA, you need to get this book (and read it).

## Distributed Computing

* [Complex Event Flows in Distributed Systems][2]. This is an [InfoQ][iq] presentation how lightweight and highly-scalable state machines ease the handling of complex logic and flows in distributed systems.

## Azure

* [Real-time data analytics and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2][3]. Microsoft recently announced [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2][4] (ADLS2), and this blog post looks at how ADLS2 can be used for real-time analytics. ADLS2 is at the moment in preview. I certainly hope that MS releases it soon. 

## Streaming

* [Keystone Real-time Stream Processing Platform][5]. This is a blog post about Keystone; Netflixâ€™s data backbone. It is an essential piece of infrastructure focusing on data analytics. I found this post very interesting, and if you are interested in stream processing, you should really read this post.
* [Streams and Tables: Two Sides of the Same Coin][6]. This blog post announces the availability of the white-paper [Streams and Tables: Two Sides of the Same Coin][7]. The paper introduces the Dual Streaming Model, which is used to reason about physical and logical order in data stream processing. This is a **MUST** read!
* [Hands on: Building a Streaming Application with KSQL][8]. In this blog post, we see how we can build a demo streaming application with KSQL, the streaming SQL engine for Apache Kafka. The application continuously computes, in real time, top music charts based on a stream of song play events.

## SQL Saturday

So the SQL Saturday "season" is over for me for this year. I did one talk in [Johannesburg][sqlsatjhb_1], two in Cape Town ([this][sqlsatcpt_ml] and [this][sqlsatcpt_sp]), and one in [Durban][sqlsatdbn_sp]. 

In addition to the conference talks I also did a full-day workshop in Cape Town and Durban about SQL Server Machine Learning Services: **[A Day of SQL Server Machine Learning Services with Niels Berglund][sqlsatdbn_pre]**.

When we talk about SQL Saturdays I want to thank the organisers in the various cities:

* [Michael Johnson][michael] and team in Johannesburg.
* [Jody Roberts][jodyr] and [Jeanne Combrink][jeanne] and their team in Cape Town.
* [Jodi Craig][jodic] and team in Durban.

They are doing a fantastic work, entirely voluntarily. A HUGE, HUGE **THANK YOU** to all of you!

## SQL Server Machine Learning Services

Now when SQL Saturday is over, I plan to get back to write about **SQL Server Machine Learning Services**. I am working right now on the third post in the [Install R Packages in SQL Server ML Services](/series/sql_server_ml_services_install_packages) series. I hope to be able to publish it in a week or two.

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
