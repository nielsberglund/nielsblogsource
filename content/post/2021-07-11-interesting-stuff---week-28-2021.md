Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth that has to do with things that interest me:

* AI/data science
* data in general
* data architecture
* streaming
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## SQL Server

* [What's new with SQL Server Big Data Clustersâ€”CU11 Release][1]. As the title implies, this blog post announces the latest release of SQL Server Big Data Cluster (BDC). Read the post to learn more about new security features as well as PolyBase enhancements.

## Big Data

* [Real-time Data Infrastructure at Uber][2]. For followers of my blog, it should not come as a surprise that I like both Kafka and Apache Pinot. The link here is to a white paper around Uber looking at how Uber uses, among other tech, Kafka and Pinot as a foundation for their real-time data infrastructure. It is an awesome and very informative read!

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

As I have mentioned previously, I am doing both a training class and a conference session at the [**2021 Data Platform Summit**][3]. Related to that, I had the opportunity to pen down a new article in the [**SQLServerGeeks Magazine**][4], where I wrote about **SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster**. The magazine has good content overall for the SQL professionals and contains a lot of really cool material. The best part of the magazine is that it is free for the community! [Download][4] your copy now.

Oh, and speaking of speaking:

**Figure 1:** *Webinar*

As you see in *Figure 1* above, I am delivering a free session at DataPlatformGeeks Webinars about SQL Server and how it can be the central hub for all your data. Do join me! Oh, you ask where to register for the webinar? You register [here][6]!

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. Please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me if you have ideas for what to cover.
