Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Distributed Computing

* [Scalable Microservice Demo K8s Istio Kafka][1]. In this post, the author shows a very "cool" example of how one can auto-scale applications in Kubernetes, using a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, (HPA), and Istio.

## Streaming

* [Deploying ML Models in Distributed Real-time Data Streaming Applications][2]. This post explores the various strategies to deploy ML models in Apache Flink/Spark or other realtime data streaming applications.
* [Sharpening your Stream Processing Skills with Kafka Tutorials][3]. In the post linked to, the author discusses the various ways we can process streams in the Kafka eco-system and points us to the [Kafka Tutorials][4] site, where we can learn about various aspects of building applications with Kafka.

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

The last few weeks, I have been somewhat lazy, (OK then, very lazy), and I have not posted much about SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster or SQL Server Extensibility framework.

That is changing now. I am working on a post about SQL Server 2019 BDC, which is based on the conference talks I have given about the BDC.

I am also doing some cool "stuff" regarding the Extensibility Framework, but at this point, I am not allowed to say what it is. But if you are interested, watch this space!

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
