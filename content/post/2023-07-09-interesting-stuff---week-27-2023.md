## Databases

* [Explaining Vector Databases in 3 Levels of Difficulty][1]. This blog post provides a comprehensive overview of vector databases. It breaks down the concept into three levels of difficulty, catering to readers with varying degrees of familiarity with the topic. Overall, this post serves as a valuable resource for understanding vector databases at different levels of expertise. I found this post very valuable and an excellent resource for anyone learning more about vector databases.

## Azure OpenAI

* [Announcing Updates to Azure OpenAI Service Models][2]. The linked blog post highlights the recent updates made to the Azure OpenAI service models. It announces the expansion of the GPT-3.5-Turbo family, new fine-tunable models, and the evolution of the initial GPT-3 models. These new models and capabilities provide users with enhanced capabilities for natural language processing and understanding. 

## Generative AI

* [LangChain: Chat with Your Data][4]. This LinkedIn post by [Andrew Ng][3] announces a free course on using LangChain. LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. The course is an excellent resource for anyone interested in learning more about LangChain and how to use it to chat with your data.
* [Using Large Language Models (LLMs) In Production][5]. This blog post discusses the practical considerations and challenges of deploying large language models (LLMs) in production environments. The author explores the benefits and drawbacks of LLMs, highlighting their potential to generate high-quality content but also acknowledging concerns related to biases and ethical implications. The post covers topics such as data preparation, model deployment, monitoring, and fine-tuning for specific use cases. It also delves into strategies for mitigating risks and ensuring the responsible usage of LLMs. Overall, this blog post provides valuable insights for organizations looking to leverage LLMs effectively and responsibly in real-world applications.
* [Prompt Engineering: Improving Our Ability to Communicate with an LLM][6]. This blog post discusses the concept of prompt engineering in the context of language models. The authors emphasize the importance of crafting effective prompts to elicit desired responses from large language models (LLMs) and improve their communication ability. They outline various techniques and strategies for prompt engineering, such as specifying the desired format, using contrast sets, and utilizing system messages. The article also explores the challenges associated with prompt engineering, including biases and robustness concerns. Overall, it highlights the significance of thoughtful, prompt design in maximizing the utility and reliability of LLMs in human-AI communication.
* [NSQL: First-Ever Fully Open-Source SQL Foundation Model][7]. The blog post linked introduces NSQL, the first fully open-source SQL foundation model. The author highlights the significance of NSQL in providing a comprehensive solution for SQL-based natural language processing (NLP) tasks. NSQL aims to bridge the gap between traditional SQL and NLP by enabling users to interact with databases using natural language queries. The post discusses the architecture and training process of NSQL, which leverages large-scale datasets and transformer-based models. It also emphasizes the benefits of an open-source approach, allowing for community contributions and customization. Overall, this blog post presents NSQL as an innovative tool for enhancing the accessibility and usability of SQL in NLP applications.

## Streaming

* [Sup July 2023][8]. This blog post is the inaugural edition of the **Streaming Updates for the People Newsletter** (SUP) by [Hubert Dulay][hubert]. In the newsletter, Hubert delves into the exciting world of data analytics in the context of streaming and real-time. He explores the latest trends, techniques, and insights that shape the landscape of streaming data analytics. I won't spoil the newsletter's content, but I can highly recommend it to anyone interested in streaming data analytics.

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

Beginning of July is always a nervous time for Microsoft MVPs, in that it is the time when Microsoft announces the MVPs for the next year:

**Figure 1:** *Renewed!!*

I am happy to announce that I have been renewed as a Microsoft MVP for 2023-2024. I am grateful for the recognition and look forward to another year of community contribution!

Speaking of contributing to the community, **Data Saturday Durban** is happening in a month (August 19). If you are in the Durban area, please join us for a day of learning and networking. We are finalising the speakers and topics as I write this. The event will be epic! You can find more information about the event and sign up [here][9].
