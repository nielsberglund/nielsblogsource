At PDC 2010 Microsoft showed the new [Async][1] features of coming C# (and VB.NET) versions, and quite a lot has been written about it already. Part of the Async CTP is **TPL Dataflow**, and this has gone somewhat un-noticed.

<!--more-->

[TPL Dataflow][2] is a library for building concurrent applications. It utilises an actor/agent-oriented designs via primitives for in-process message passing, dataflow, and pipelining.Â It looks and feels a bit like [Axum][3], and one can wonder if TPL Dataflow will be the productization (is this a word?) of Axum, especially as Axum's future seems a bit [unclear][4] at the moment.

I am at the moment writing some test-code for TPL Dataflow, which I will post as soon as I have tidied it up a bit. In the meantime [Matt Davey][5], has quite a few [posts about TPL Dataflow][6] on his blog. So if you are interested, go and have a look.
