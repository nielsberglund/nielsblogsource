Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Misc.

* [How to integrate Python and R in Visual Studio Code][1]. I really like VSCode, but I always have issues with how to configure for Python and R when installing from scratch. So this blog-post comes in real handy, as it explains what one needs to do to get Python and R up and running in VSCode. Awesome!

## Data Science

* [Synthetic Data Vault (SDV): A Python Library for Dataset Modeling][2]. When doing machine learning/data science, you need realistic data to work with, and that can sometimes be a problem. This post introduces the Synthetic Data Vault, which is a tool to generate complex datasets using statistical & machine-learning models. It looks very interesting!
* [Turning Metadata Into Insights with Databook][3]. This post looks at Uber's system for handling metadata - Databook.

## Streaming

* [Using Apache Pinot and Kafka to Analyze GitHub Events][4]. Apache Pinot is a real-time distributed OLAP datastore, which is used to deliver scalable real-time analytics with low latency. The post I linked to here discusses how to ingest Kafka events into Pinot. What we see in the blog post is very interesting for [us](/derivco), and we will definitely look at it in more detail.

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

In [last weeks roundup][8] I wrote about my recording of video for the Data Platform Summit 2020.

If I haven't said it before:

I am super excited to be speaking at the [**Data Platform Virtual Summit 2020**][5]. A 100% technical learning event with 200 Breakout Sessions, 30 Training Classes, 72 hours of non-stop conference sessions â€“ DPS 2020 is the largest online learning event on Microsoft Azure Data, Analytics & Artificial Intelligence. Delegates get the recordings at no extra cost, which is quite a wonderful thing. Also, the conference virtual platform looks amazing, [take a look][6].

If you want to attend and hear industry experts talk about really exciting stuff you can [book here][7]. Oh, and the coolest thing is that as I am a speaker I get a discount code to hand out to you guys! Use the discount code **DPSSPEAKER** to book your seat at **55%** off.

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
