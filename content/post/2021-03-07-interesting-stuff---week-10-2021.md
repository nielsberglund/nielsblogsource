Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth that has to do with things that interest me:

* AI/data science
* data in general
* data architecture
* streaming
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## .NET

* [Internals of the POH][1]. A new kind of heap was added in .NET 5, called the POH (Pinned Object Heap). This blog entry explains the internals of it.

## Distributed Systems

* [Foundational distributed systems papers][2]. It is well known that if someone wants to develop competence and expertise in their fields, reading technical research papers is - almost - a must. [Murat][murba] has compiled a list of foundational papers in the distributed systems area in the blog post here. Go ahead and read! 

## Databases

* [VACCINATION DATABASE TECH TALKS - 2021][3]. The "Vaccination Database Tech Talks" is an on-line seminar series at Carnegie Mellon University with leading developers and researchers of database systems. Each speaker will present the implementation details of their respective systems and examples of the technical challenges that they faced when working with real-world customers. I have had a look at some of them, and they are really interesting!

## AI/Machine Learning

* [How Microsoft Icebreaker Addresses the Cold-Start Challenge in Machine Learning Models][4]. This post looks at a framework for intelligent acquisition of training data. This, in turn, allows the deployment of machine learning models that can operate with little or no-training data.

## Streaming

* [KAFKA SUMMIT 2021][5]. It is this time of the year again; conference time. The page linked to here is the registration page for Kafka Summit 2021. It allows you to register for the three different (virtual) summits this year. I have registered for the [Europe Summit][6]. I suggest you do the same!

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
