Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, etc., that has to do with things that interest me

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This is the "roundup" of the posts that has been most interesting to me, for the week just gone by. 

<!--more-->

## SQL Server

* [PASS Summit 2017 â€“ a personal angle][1]. Where [Ewald][ew] goes to Seattle to attend [PASS 2017][2]. A personal take on the summit, prior to its opening. Entertaining as ever!!
* [In-Memory OLTP Indexes][4]. The first post in a series about in memory indexes in SQL Server. 

## Databases

* [CockroachDB][3]. I don't know about the name, but the technology looks very, very interesting. 

## .NET

* [Modernize existing .NET apps with Windows Containers and Azure][5]. Basically a "plug" for a free e-book. However as the topic is of interest to me, I decided to include it. Plus, the comments are interesting.

## Streaming

* [Apache Kafka Goes 1.0][6]. Yay!! Apache Kafka has reached the 1.0 milestone. This blog-post talks about that, but also all the new improvements in Apache Kafka 1.0.

## Data Science

* [Sentiment analysis with Python in SQL Server Machine Learning Services][7]. This blog post, shows two different ways to implement sentiment analysis in SQL Server using Python and Machine Learning Services. Very cool!!
* [Why Probability Theory Should be Thrown Under the Bus][8]. A blog-post discussing the downside of probability theory. Really, really interesting and thought provoking! 

## SQL Server R Services

* [Microsoft SQL Server R Services - Internals XII][si12]. I managed to get [Internals - XII][si12] out this week. It covers what routines sends the packets from SQL Server to the **SqlSatellite**, and what are some of those packets.

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
