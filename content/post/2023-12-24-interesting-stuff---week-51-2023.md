* [KIP-939: Support Participation in 2PC][8]. This KIP (Kafka Improvement Proposals) is something that I want to see - to support participation in Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocols within Kafka. The document specifically addresses Kafka's role as a participant in 2PC. It explains how Kafka's internal transactions are distributed and how the 2PC maps to Kafka's protocol. It also identifies the main requirement for a participant in a 2PC protocol: once prepared, it cannot abort or commit independently. It must wait for a decision made by the external transaction coordinator. The scope of the KIP is to enable Kafka to participate in a 2PC protocol and build a foundation for a dual-write recipe. The document details the solution requirements and constraints, proposed changes, public interfaces, RPC changes, and persisted data format changes. This KIP represents a significant enhancement to Kafka's transaction capabilities, particularly in the context of distributed systems and microservices architectures, where ensuring data consistency across different components and services is crucial. As a side note; I came across this KIP thanks to [Robin Moffat][rmoff]'s and [Gunnar Morling][10]'s excellent [Checkpoint Chronicle][9] newsletter. The Checkpoint Chronicle is a monthly roundup of interesting stuff in the data and streaming space. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend subscribing to it.
