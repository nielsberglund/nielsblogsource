Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Misc.

* [An Incremental Architecture Approach to Building Systems][1]. An [InfoQ][iq] article about building systems and how, to avoid over-engineering, we should start with a simple architecture and evolve it as needs arise.

## .NET

* [System.Data in .NET Core 3.0][2]. The first of two [InfoQ][iq] articles about `System.Data` in .NET Core 3.0. The article looks at what changes there are in .NET Core 3.0 for `System.Data`.
* [SQL Server and .NET Core 3.0][3]. The second [InfoQ][iq] article about `System.Data` in .NET Core 3.0. This time the attention is at `System.Data.SqlClient`, which is the SQL Server driver.

## Streaming

* [Getting Your Feet Wet with Stream Processing â€“ Part 2: Testing Your Streaming Application][4]. The second and last part of a two-part blog series about developing and validating real-time streaming applications. This post looks at how we test streaming applications.
* [Scaling a Distributed Stream Processor in a Containerized Environment][5]. This [InfoQ][iq] article presents ideas and experiences around scaling a distributed stream processor in Kubernetes. The article discusses how the stream processor should identify the level of resource requirement and scale accordingly.  

## WIND (What is Niels Doing)

* [SQL Server 2019 & Java with Visual Studio Code][6]. A blog-post looking at how we can write SQL Server Java code using **Visual Studio Code**, the *VS Code*'s Java extension, and Maven.

If you are at [**Microsoft Ignite | The Tour**][7] in Johannesburg at the end of the month, please come by and say Hi! I deliver three sessions:

* **What is That Cup of Coffee Doing in my Database?** - A 15 minutes whirl-wind tour about the new Java language extension in SQL Server 2019.
* **SQL Server Machine Learning Services: An E2E platform for machine learning** - A 60-minute break-out session where we look at how SQL Server Machine Learning Services serves as an end-to-end ML platform for customers.
* **Deep dive on SQL Server and big data** - A 60-minute break-out session where we do a deep dive behind the technology for big data integration with SQL Server including Kubernetes, Polybase futures, and scalable performance. 

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
