Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, etc., that has to do with things that interest me

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This is the "roundup" of the posts that has been most interesting to me, for the week just gone by. 

<!--more-->

## Programming

* [Functional Programming Languages and the Pursuit of Laziness with Dr. Simon Peyton Jones][1]. A transcript of a pod-cast with [Simon Peyton Jones][2], where the discussion is around functional programming and laziness :). Both the pod-cast as well as the transcript was very interesting (and entertaining).

## Streaming

* [How To Size Your Apache FlinkÂ® Cluster: A Back-of-the-Envelope Calculation][3]. Sizing an Apache Flink cluster can be a bit daunting. This post outlines a series of questions to ask to arrive at some numbers you can use as guidance.
* [Apache Mesos, Apache Kafka and Kafka Streams for Highly Scalable Microservices][4]. This blog post discusses how to build a highly scalable, mission-critical microservice infrastructure with Apache Kafka, its Streams API, and Apache Mesos respectively in their vendor-supported platforms from Confluent and Mesosphere. It's a must read!!

## Data Science

* [Mastering chess and shogi by self-play with a general reinforcement learning algorithm][5]. AlphaZero is an AI program from [DeepMind][6], which  masters Go, shogi and chess. In this blog-post [Adrian][adcol] from [the morning paper][mp] dissects a white-paper about AlphaZero. 
* [Services and tools for building intelligent R applications in the cloud][7]. A blog-post from [Revolution Analytics][re] about application areas and associated applications and Azure services that can be used to deploy high performance R enterprise applications

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
