In my [Goodbye Jekyll, Welcome Hugo!][1] post I wrote how I have changed blog engine from Jekyll to Hugo, and how everything seemed to work. Saying that obviously jinxed it, as after I deployed to the hosting site my Atom feed was completely hosed.

I have now spent 4 hours trying to fix everything, but I am not sure I have succeeded. So this is a test post to see if things look OK.

I also want to apologise if I have messed up your feeds, as at one stage I saw in my feeds a lot of duplicates posts from me. Sorry!
