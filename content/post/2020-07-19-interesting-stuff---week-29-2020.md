Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Big Data

* [Implementing a Data Lake or Data Warehouse Architecture for Business Intelligence?][1]. In this post, the author explains what business intelligence is, and compares Data warehouse and Data Lake architecture for doing Business intelligence. Interesting read, even though I may not agree with some of the sentiments in the post.
* [Spark + AI Summit Reflections][2]. The [Spark + AI Summit][3] was held June 22 - 26, and this post looks at some of the interesting keynotes and sessions from a developers perspective. Some cool "stuff" in there!

## Data Science

* [Using Continuous Machine Learning to Run Your ML Pipeline][4]. We live in a DevOps and CI/CD world! However, when doing Machine Learning, it is somewhat tricky. This post introduces [Continuous Machine Learning][5], (CML), which is an open-source library for implementing continuous integration & delivery (CI/CD) in machine learning projects. Looks very interesting!

## Streaming

* [Top 5 Reasons to Attend Kafka Summit Virtually][6]. So the virtual [Kafka Summit 2020][7] is right around the corner. In the linked post [Tim Berglund][timb], (no, we are not related), lists some reason why you should attend. I have registered, and I hope to see you there!

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

Still in lockdown, and still no end in sight for follow up post to [**A Lap Around SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster: Background & Technology**][8]. I am working on it, but can't seem to get the words onto paper, or rather the screen. The post is supposed to be about the architecture of the Big Data Cluster.

On Tuesday, (July 21), I am co-hosting the third [**The Azure Sketches, Architect Series**][9] webinar together with Gordon Beeming and Lawrance Reddy. We use a combination of traditional drawing & sketching with actual solution building to help reinforce the thought process in building Azure solutions and all of the dependencies in between. If you are interested, [here][9] is the link for registration.

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
