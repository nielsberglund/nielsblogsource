---

This week's blog post delves into the fascinating realms of data architecture, generative AI, and streaming systems. I explore James Serra's insightful book on navigating complex data architectures.

In the GenAI space I look at Microsoft Research's groundbreaking AI Controller Interface for enhancing LLM control. Finally Neil Avery's compelling take on the synergy between Data Mesh and Hexagonal Architecture using Kafka. I hope you find these articles as intriguing as I did. Enjoy!

## Data

* [My data architecture book is published!][1]. This post by [James Serra][jserra] announces the publication of his book, **Deciphering Data Architectures: Choosing Between a Modern Data Warehouse, Data Fabric, Data Lakehouse, and Data Mesh**. The book is initially available in eBook format on Amazon, with a paperback edition to follow shortly. This book aims to demystify the complex world of data architectures for data professionals. It provides a comprehensive guide to understanding modern data architectures' strengths, weaknesses, and practical applications, including data fabric, data lakehouse, and data mesh. It helps readers navigate the hype and make informed decisions for their data architecture needs. I have already bought the book and will be reading it soon.

## Generative AI

* [AI Controller Interface: Generative AI with a lightweight, LLM-integrated VM][2]. Microsoft Research introduces, in this article, the AI Controller Interface (AICI), a groundbreaking approach designed to enhance the control over large language models (LLMs) while maintaining high efficiency and security. The AICI, featuring a "prompt-as-program" interface, allows for seamless integration of user-level code with LLM output generation in the cloud, supporting existing security frameworks and enabling rapid experimentation. At the heart of this system is a lightweight virtual machine, the AI Controller, which operates atop the interface, allowing developers and researchers to finely tune LLM outputs without compromising performance. This innovative system addresses the challenges of ensuring content accuracy and strict format compliance, such as JSON, in fields where confidentiality and reliability are paramount. With AICI, Microsoft is paving the way for more secure, accurate, and customizable generative AI applications, promising significant advancements in how we interact with and control AI-generated content.

## Streaming

* [On the alignment of Data Mesh and the Hexagonal Architecture â€” using Kafka][3]. In this post by [Neil Avery][neilav], Neil explores the synergistic relationship between Data Mesh and Hexagonal Architecture in data management and software architecture, emphasizing their alignment with Domain-Driven Design principles. By integrating Kafka and SpecMesh, Avery presents a compelling approach to constructing resilient and distributed systems. Data Mesh's decentralized data management complements Hexagonal Architecture's modular structure, with Kafka acting as a vital communication backbone, facilitating loose coupling and event-driven interactions between domains. SpecMesh further enhances this alignment by applying Data Mesh principles to APIs and services, promoting autonomy and loose coupling. These methodologies offer a robust framework for building scalable, adaptable, and efficient systems, providing a strategic advantage in the ever-evolving technological landscape.

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. Please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me if you have ideas for what to cover.
