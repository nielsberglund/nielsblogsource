Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## .NET

* [.NET Core Worker Service as Windows Service or Linux Daemons][1]. This post discusses a new .NET Core 3 application template called "Worker Service". The template makes it easy to write Windows Services or Linux Daemons.

## SQL Server

* [JSON in your Azure SQL Database? Letâ€™s benchmark some options!][2]. This Microsoft post discusses and benchmarks options on how to handle JSON in SQL Server.
* [Optimize OLTP Performance with SQL Server on Azure VM][3]. This article shares recommendations on how to optimize SQL Server performance on Azure VMs. The article is based on performance testing with a somewhat scaled-down [TPC-E][4] benchmark. 

## Streaming

* [Skipping bad records with the Kafka Connect JDBC sink connector][5]. This post by the Kafka guru [Robin Moffat][rmoff] discusses how to handle bad records when using the JDBC sink connector in Kafka Connect. Very interesting!
* [KCACHE: AN IN-MEMORY CACHE BACKED BY KAFKA][6]. This post details how you can have an in-memory cache backed by Kafka. Excellent!
* [Using Kafka Connect and Debezium with Confluent Cloud][7]. This is yet another awesome post by [Robin][rmoff]. One where he discusses how you can use Debezium together with Confluent Cloud.

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
