# Derivco

[**Derivco**][1] is a leading developer of software for the online gaming industry. That doesn't mean however it is a gaming company; no, it is a **technology** company. In order to stay competitive we have to be on the forefront of technology, and we are continuously researching new technology as well as pushing the edge of existing technology.

We probably have one of the biggest install base of Microsoft SQL Server's with a couple of hundred SQL Server boxes in our datacenters across the world. Each server box runs several SQL Server instances (SQL 2014 and SQL 2016), each with multiple databases. We are at the moment researching SQL Server v.Next, and will without a doubt come up with new and innovative solutions using it, in order to make our products even better.

**Derivco** is not only SQL Server, no - we have a multitude of Web API's, Windows Services and micro-services written in **.NET** (mostly **C#**) and **C++**. Other technologies we use are:

* Azure Dev Ops
* Raw TCP/IP Sockets
* RabbitMQ
* Kafka
* KStreams & KSQL
* Service Fabric
* Kubernetes
* Docker
* Web Sockets
* Signal R
* HTML 5
* Flash
* iOS
* Android

So if you are an exceptional developer, and you like a challenge - please do not hesitate to [send your CV](https://humancapitalmanagement.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/Derivco-SA-Careers). We have offices, not only in Durban SA, but also in:
