# Building an Event Management System with Claude Code

This is the "Table of Content" for the **Building an Event Management System with Claude Code** series detailing my journey to build an AI-driven contact and event management system.

## Table of Content

* [**Building an Event Management System with Claude Code: Installing Claude Code**][1]: We introduced the project and looked at the steps to install Claude Code on both macOS as well as Windows. (Edited: 2025-12-20)
* [**Building an Event Management System with Claude Code: Part 2 - IDE Integration**][2]: Learn VS Code integration with Claude Code for AI-assisted development. Includes WSL setup, CLAUDE.md configuration, and building your first API endpoints. (Edited: 2025-12-20)
* [**Building an Event Management System with Claude Code: Part 3 - Architecting an AI-Native System**][3]: Part 3 shows how Claude Code helps architect an event management system using MCP servers, PostgreSQL, and natural language interfaces. 
* [**Building an Event Management System with Claude Code: Part 4 - Database Setup and First Conversations**][4]: In Part 4 we build production-ready database infrastructure using Claude Code. Learn PostgreSQL setup on Neon, Postgres MCP Pro configuration, and AI-assisted troubleshooting.
* [**Building an Event Management System with Claude Code: Part 5 - Database Schema and Natural Language Queries**][5]: In Part 5 you transform database development with Claude Code and Postgres MCP Pro. Design schemas, generate test data, and run complex queries—all through conversation.
* [**Building an Event Management System with Claude Code: Part 5.5 - Schema Refinement: When Real Data Reveals the Truth**][55]: In this post we see how a database schema design mistake turned lesson: How uploading real CSV files to Claude Code revealed missing fields and enabled a 45-minute schema refinement migration.
* [**Building an Event Management System with Claude Code: Part 6 - Architecture and Design of a Custom Import MCP Server**][6]: Design a custom Import MCP Server with Claude Code for AI-native data imports. Learn why MCP servers are isolated, architect 7 self-contained tools, and transform CSV hell into conversational workflows. Complete architecture guide.
* [**Building an Event Management System with Claude Code: Part 7 - Implementing the Import MCP Server**][7]: Part 7: Build an Import MCP Server with Claude Code; 3 hours vs 16 traditional. FastMCP implementation, validation tools, database troubleshooting, and real AI-native development lessons.
* [**Building an Event Management System with Claude Code: Part 8 - Implementing Import Functions**][8]: Part 8: Discover how Claude Code implemented import functions, reviewed its own code, and transformed a 20-minute process into 2 seconds. AI-native development in action..
