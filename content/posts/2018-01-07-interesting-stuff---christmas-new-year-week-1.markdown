Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, etc., that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This is the "roundup" of the posts that has been most interesting to me over the Christmas and New Year period.

<!--more-->

## SQL Server

Quite some JSON related topics in this roundup.

* [Building SQL REST API back-end for Angular apps][1]. In this post [Jovan][jovpop] (who is the SQL Server JSON "god") shows how easy it is to build back-end REST API for Angular sample app using JSON functionalities in SQL Server.
* [Transitive closure clustering with CLR and JSON][2]. [Jovan][jovpop] shows how a [transitive closure][3] algorithm can be implemented using CLR aggregates that can be placed in SQL database.
* [Injecting JSON objects into existing JSON text with JSON_MODIFY function][4]. Yet another post by "Mr. SQL Server JSON" - [Jovan][jovpop] - showing how to update existing JSON text and inject JSON object in the text, avoiding some common mistakes. 

## Streaming

* [KSQL December Release: Streaming SQL for Apache Kafka][5]. A post about that is in the December release of the streaming SQL engine for Apache Kafka - **KSQL**.

## Databases

* [A Machine Learning Approach to Databases Indexes][6]. A white-paper about how traditional B-tree indexes potentially can be replaced with more flexible, faster, and smaller machine learned neural networks. Very interesting!!

## Distributed Computing

* [WPaxos: a wide area network Paxos protocol (Part 1)][7]. [Paxos][10] is a protocol for solving the fault-tolerant coordination problem in a datacenter - and it is very good at what it is doing. However across datacenters the WAN latency may be too high. In this post [Murat][murba] discusses an alternative to Paxos - WPaxos.
* [Entity Oriented Microservices][8]. A very interesting article by [David][daveda] about Entity Services vs. Microservices vs. DDD.

## Data Science

* [DevOps for Data Science â€“ Continuous Delivery][9]. [Buck Woody][buckw] continues his series about DevOps for Data Science, and in this episode he discusses Continuous Delivery. A very interesting post as well as series!!
* [TensorFlow-Serving: Flexible, High-Performance ML Serving][11]. Another post by [Murat][murba], this time about a system/framework to serve machine learning (ML) models.
* [Paper summary. Real-Time Machine Learning: The Missing Pieces][12]. [Murat][murba] has been busy the holiday period. In this post he dissects a white-paper about real time machine learning, and what is required. This is an area, I am really interested in BTW!!

## SQL Server R Services

During the holiday period I managed to get some work done on the Microsoft SQL Server R Services series:

* [Microsoft SQL Server R Services - Internals XVI][si16]. In [Internals - XVI][si16] I talked about the result set data coming back from the SqlSatellite, and I looked at number of packets as well as packet sizes.
* [Microsoft SQL Server R Services - Internals XVII][si17]. [Internals - XVII][si17] continues on from [Internals - XVI][si16], and looks at what happens inside SQL Server when result-set data comes back.

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
