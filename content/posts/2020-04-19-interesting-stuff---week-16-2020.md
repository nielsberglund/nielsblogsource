Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Data Science

* [Forecasting Best Practices, from Microsoft][1]. It is a long time since I have linked to something from [Revolution Analytics][re]. That is now rectified by this post where [David][revod] points to resources from Microsoft around best practices around time series forecasting. Have a look, quite a lot of cool stuff there!
* [Rendezvous Architecture for Data Science in Production][4]. In this post the author discusses one of the biggest problems in Data Science today how to productionise your models. The answer to that problem is something called the Rendezvous Architecture. 

## Distributed Computing

* [Better design, implementation, and testing of async systems with Coyote][3]. In the [Interesting Stuff - Week 13, 2020][2] I wrote about Coyote, the framework for building reliable asynchronous software. The link here is a registration page for a webinar April 30 about Coyote. If you are interested in things like async and distributed systems, then I suggest you register. See you there!

## Event Driven Architecture

* [Event-Driven Data Collection][5]. I linked to some posts about Event Driven Architecture in the [Interesting Stuff - Week 14, 2020][6] post, and the post linked to here is by the same author as the posts in the [week 14][6] roundup. In this post, the author discusses how to populate databases from event-driven data collection.

## Streaming

* [Whatâ€™s New in Apache Kafka 2.5][7]. Apache Kafka version 2.5 was released earlier this week, and the post here discusses new "stuff" in the release.
* [Real-Time Small Business Intelligence with ksqlDB][8]. In this post, the author makes the point that the Kafka ecosystem is not only for the Netflix:es in this world, but that by using ksqlDB even smaller companies can gain insights into their data.
* [A quick and dirty way to monitor data arriving on Kafka][9]. The title of this post describes the post perfectly. [Robin Moffat][rmoff] shows a way to quickly and easily monitor Kafka data, and be alerted if something happens. Actually be alerted if something does not happen (data arriving).

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me. Most importantly, stay safe out there!
