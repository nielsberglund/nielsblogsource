Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Distributed Computing

* [Designing Distributed Systems with TLA+][]. An [InfoQ][iq] presentation where the presenter discusses the ideas behind TLA+, which is a specification language that describes a system, its properties, and how it works.

## .NET

* [Using .NET and Docker Together â€“ DockerCon 2019 Update][2]. This post is about the improvements and new features in .NET Core 3.0 related to Docker and running your code in Docker.

## Databases

* [YugaByte DB - A Planet-scale Database for Low Latency Transactional Apps][3]. This is an [InfoQ][iq] presentation introducing and demoing YugaByte DB, a large scale DB, highlighting distributed transactions with global consistency.

## Data Science

* [Detecting Financial Fraud at Scale with Decision Trees and MLflow on Databricks][4]. An excellent post about how to use Databricks to detect fraud. Why I like this article is because of the sample code, it makes it easy to follow along.

## Streaming

* [Optimizing Kafka Streams Applications][5]. This article discusses how one can optimize Kafka Stream applications based on the new processor topology optimization framework which Kafka Streams 2.1 introduced.
* [The PipelineDB Team Joins Confluent][6]. I had no idea that [PipelineDB][7] existed before this blog post. In my mind, PipelineDB joining Confluent can be huge, and I cannot wait to see what they dream up.
* [Load-Balanced Apache Kafka: Derivco's Globally Distributed Gaming Business][8]. My colleague [Charl Lamprecht][charl] and I had the pleasure of being interviewed by Tim Berglund (no relations) for a Kafka podcast. We, or rather Charl as I had audio issues, spoke about Kafka, load balancing via F5's and the journey we have had to get Kafka implemented in [Derivco](/derivco).

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
