So yesterday I [posted][DenaliFeatures] my wish-list for new programmability features in the upcoming release of SQL 11 / Denali.

Today I see that Simon S has [posted][2] about a new series of posts he will do, covering what is new in SQL 11. Knowing Simon, it will be really, really good. So if you are interested I suggest you keep your eyes open for his posts.

**UPDATE**: Ben C commented and said that CTP1 has been released (or something to that effect), and [here][4] is where it can be downloaded from.
