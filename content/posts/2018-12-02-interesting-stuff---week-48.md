Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Azure

* [Considering Azure Functions for a serverless data streaming scenario][1]. A blog post which describes a solution of using Azure server-less to create a data pipeline to detect fraudulent transactions. Quite a lot of exciting technologies/solutions!
* [Getting Started with data Artisans Platform on Azure Kubernetes Service][3]. The [dA Platform][2] is a production-ready stream processing infrastructure that includes open-source Apache Flink, and it is purpose-built for the stateful stream processing architecture. This blog post discusses how to get the dA Platform up and running on Azure Kubernetes Service.

## Streaming

* [Whatâ€™s new in the latest Apache Flink 1.7.0 release][4]. As per the title. This blog post mentions some new functionality in the 1.7.0 release of Apache Flink. The new `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` functionality looks very juicy!
* [Apache Avro as a Built-in Data Source in Apache Spark 2.4][5]. Starting from the Apache Spark 2.4 release, Spark provides built-in support for reading and writing Avro data. This blog post examines the functionality in detail.
* [3 Ways to Prepare for Disaster Recovery in Multi-Datacenter Apache Kafka Deployments][6]. What it says in the title - how we can prepare for disaster recovery in Kafka environments. 

## SQL Server 2019

* [SQL Server 2019 Extensibility Framework & Java - Hello World][7]. In the roundup for last [week][8] I wrote how I was working on a blog post about the new Java functionality in SQL Server 2019. This is it. In this post I take a look at how to install and enable the Java extensions. The post finishes with some very simple Java code which I execute from SQL Server. Do not be surprised if more posts comes shortly about Java.

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
