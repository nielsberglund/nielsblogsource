Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## .NET

* [How to Develop and Debug ASP.NET Core Applications in Kubernetes][1]. This is an interesting post looking at developing ASP.NET Core applications for Kubernetes using a tool/framework called [Okteto][2].

## Misc.

* [Mock APIs vs. Real Backends â€“ Getting the Best of Both Worlds][4]. The post linked to here from the Confluent discusses whether to mock or not and if you can do both. 

## Streaming

* [How Netflix uses Druid for Real-time Insights to Ensure a High-Quality Experience][3]. A few years ago we looked at Druid in [Derivco](/derivco) and evaluated if we could use it. Nothing came out of it, but from reading this post, maybe we should look again.
* [Architecture for High-Throughput Low-Latency Big Data Pipeline on Cloud][5]. Don't let the title of this post fool you; this is not cloud specific. The post discusses tools and techniques for building data pipelines for Big Data.
* [Kafka Needs No Keeper][6]. In this [InfoQ][iq] presentation, the presenter talks about the ongoing effort to replace the use of Zookeeper in Kafka: the reasons for why it should be done and how it will work.

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
