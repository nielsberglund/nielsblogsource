Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, etc., that has to do with things that interest me

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This is the "roundup" of the posts that has been most interesting to me, for the week just gone by. 

<!--more-->

## SQL Server

* [Hey! What's the deal with SQL Server NOCOUNT and T-SQL WHILE loops?][1]. [Lonny][lonny] investigates `NOCOUNT` and potential performance implications using it.
* [SQL Server 2017: The worldâ€™s first enterprise-class diskless database][2]. A very interesting post from [Bob Ward][bobw] discussing extremely impressive SQL Server 2017 performance figures, where SQL Server runs on SUSE Linux on boxes equipped with [Hewlett Packard Enterprise scalable persistent memory][3].

## Streaming

* [Confluent Cloud: Enterprise-Ready, Hosted Apache Kafka is Here!][4]. You can now host [Confluent Cloud][5] in AWS without having to think about deploying servers, monitoring load, and upgrading brokers. This is cool, but now I want to see it on Azure as well.
* [Introducing Confluent Platform 4.0][6]. Quite a few Confluent/Kafka notifications this week. This is about a new version of the Confluent Platform. As the title says; version 4.0. Confluent Platform improves Apache Kafka by expanding its integration capabilities, adding tools to optimize and manage Kafka clusters, and methods to ensure the streams are secure.
* [Toward a Functional Programming Analogy for Microservices][7]. Yet another post about Kafka. This talks about implementing microservices using functional programming model, together with [CQRS][8], [Event Sourcing][9] and Kafka. Really, really interesting read!

## Data Science

* [Developing and Operationalizing H2O.ai Models with Azure][10]. This post provides an overview of how to efficiently develop and operationalize [H2O.ai][11] ML models on Azure.
* [On dataflow systems, Naiad and Tensorflow][12]. [Murat][murat] looks at data flow systems and compares [TensorFlow][13] with Microsoft's [Naiad][14]. I obviously had heard about TensorFlow, and even written blog-posts about it, but Naiad was new to me. It sounds very interesting but when you look at the GitHub repo, the newest contributions are 3 years old. ~~That makes me winder whether the project is still alive.~~ Reading some comments in the repo, it seems Naiad is abandoned - pity!

## SQL Server R Services

* [Microsoft SQL Server R Services - Internals XV][si15]. A continuation of what I covered in [Internals - XIV], here I look at packets sizes as in TDS vs. BXL. I also look at what happens inside SQL Server when it sends a BXL packet to the SQL Satellite. 

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
