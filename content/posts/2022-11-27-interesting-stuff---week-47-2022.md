Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth that has to do with things that interest me:

* AI/data science
* data in general
* data architecture
* streaming
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Misc.

* [AWS and Blockchain][1]. This is a very interesting post, looking at - as the title implies - AWS and Blockchain. The reasoning behind AWS not investing in Blockchain is eye-opening.

## Databases

* [What is a distributed database and how do they work?][2]. Distributed systems/architecture is nowadays mainstream in the world of software development. In the database world, not so much, but that is slowly changing. This post looks at what a distributed database is and its use cases.

## Azure Data Explorer

* [Getting started with Open Telemetry and Azure Data Explorer][3]. This post looks at using Open Telemetry's (OTel) Azure Data Explorer exporter to ingest data generated by OTel into Azure Data Explorer clusters. Very cool!

## AI/ML

* [Machine Learning for Fraud Detection in Streaming Services][4]. Netflix streaming services serve content to millions of users all over the world. Certain restrictions exist, such as the number of active devices, the number of streams, etc. Having million of users across makes for a large attack surface for fraud, and being able to detect fraud in real time is of vital importance. This post looks at some of Netflix's real-time fraud detection strategies. 

## SQL Server

* [SQL Server 2022 is now generally available][5]. I guess the title of this post says it all: SQL Server 2022 is no longer in preview - it has been released! Apart from announcing the release, the post looks at some of the new functionality.
* [Azure SQL Database External REST Endpoints Integration Public Preview][6]. This post introduces the ability to call an external REST endpoint from an Azure SQL database. Quite interesting!

## Streaming

* [In the land of the sizing, the one-partition Kafka topic is king][7]. This post is the first in a series looking at partitions in Kafka. In the post, the author looks at what a Kafka partition is. I recommend anyone working with Kafka to read this!

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

This is not so much about what I am doing as what I not have been doing :disappointed:.

As I wrote in the [last roundup][8], I was about to fly out to Seattle and the PASS Summit. After the Summit this weekend, I would present at Azure Bootcamp South Africa. 

During my flight to Seattle (boy, Seattle is a looong way away from Durban :smile:), I started to feel like I was coming down with a cold, and I did. It worsened during the week, and I spent most of my time in bed in my hotel. However, I managed to do my talk, and it went really well.

The cold did not get any better, and on Wednesday last week, I had to make the difficult decision to cancel my talks at the Bootcamp :cry:. So, as you can understand, I am not a "happy camper" right now.

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. Please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me if you have ideas for what to cover.
