Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Distributed Computing

* [More Environments Will Not Make Things Easier][1]. I found this blog-post - and [Tyler][tylert]'s excellent blog - by "accident" . In the post [Tyler][tylert] discusses microservices and the challenges we have in an enterprise with development environments. This is a topic close to my heart as we struggle with this at [Derivco](/derivco). Oh and BTW, when you read this post - do yourself a favour and browse the other posts on the [site][2], they are worth their weight in gold!
* [Titus, the Netflix container management platform, is now open source][3]. A blog post announcing Netflix open sourcing its container management platform: [Titus][4]. From the post: *Titus offers a convenient model for managing compute resources, allows developers to maintain just their application artifacts, and provides a consistent developer experience from a developerâ€™s laptop to production by leveraging Netflix container-focused engineering tools.* Very interesting! 
* [Skyway: connecting managed heaps in distributed big data systems][5]. In this post [Adrian][adcol] dissects a white paper about how to create a cluster of JVMs, and efficiently copy objects across remote heaps in the cluster. 

## Streaming

* [Concepts and Patterns for Streaming Services with Apache Kafka][6]. Back in the [Interesting Stuff - Week 12][wr12_18] post, I linked to a presentation by [Ben Stopford][benstop] discussing microservices and streaming using Kafka. It turns out [Ben][benstop] has authored a book about how service-based architectures and stream processing tools such as Apache Kafka can help you build business-critical systems. The link is for a free download of that book. I can warmly recommend the book!
* [Kafka Summit London][11]. The Kafka summit in London just ended. This post is to a page where you find links to the keynote presentations. They are well worth watching! 

## Data Science

* [Transfer Learning for Text using Deep Learning Virtual Machine (DLVM)][7]. A blog post which compares multiple Machine Reading Comprehension models with each other. For the model creation as well as the comparison, the [Deep Learning Virtual Machine][8] was used.
* [MACHINE LEARNING YEARNING][9]. This link is to a sign-up page for a book which [Andrew NG][10], of deep learning fame, is in the process of writing.

## SQL Server Machine Learning Services

I am busy writing a post correcting some errors I did in the last post ([sp_execute_external_script - III][sext3]) in the [SQL Server R Services](/sql_server_2k16_r_services) series. I hope to publish it in a week or so.

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
