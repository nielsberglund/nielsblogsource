Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Data

* [A Guide To The Data Lake â€” Modern Batch Data Warehousing][1]. Lately I have come across blog posts about data, data lakes, data warehousing, etc. Maybe that's because we are now looking at this at [Derivco](/derivco), and how an ideal data architecture would look like for us. Anyway, the post here discusses how one can redefine batch data extraction and the data lake.

## .NET

* [An Introduction to DataFrame][2]. I don't know how I missed this before, but this post announces a data frame data type for .NET. The DataFrame type can come in very handy in a project I'm working on right now. We'll see!

## Events

* [Events are the Key to Master Data][3]. The blog post linked to here discusses events as a type of data, and why events are essential.

* [The Path to Event-Driven Mastery][4]. This post is a follow-up to the one above. In this post, the author gives a quick overview of different concepts related to events and how they are similar or different from each other. 

## Streaming

* [Real-Time Data Replication with ksqlDB][5]. This post looks at how functionality in Kafka's ksqlDB is used to replicate data from multiple sources to data warehouses.

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

Last week [I mentioned][6] how South Africa is now in lock-down due to the Coronavirus, and how the muse has left me, and I cannot get a SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster blog post out.

Well, we are still in lock-down, we are going into the second week now. Fortunately, I live in a house with a garden and pool, so I can at least get outside. To get some exercise, I yesterday walked around the pool: 50 laps, which is around two kilometres! Before the lock-down, the thought of walking around the pool for exercise would never, ever have entered my mind!

And for the muse, no I did not find her on my walk. I hope she'll be back soon!

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me. Most importantly, stay safe out there!
