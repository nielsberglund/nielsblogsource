Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Streaming

* [The Changing Face of ETL][1]. An article by [Robin Moffat][rmoff] about the "new" ETL, based on event-driven architectures and streaming platforms. 
* [Kafka Donuts][2]. This post is the introduction and TOC to a series of posts about Kafka. The author is my colleague [Charl Lamprecht][charl], and in the series, he discusses the use of Kafka in a company who manufactures and sells Donuts. Reading the series introduction post, it is clear that this series is a **MUST** for everyone interested in Kafka. The first episode: **Donut Broker** is [here][3], and the second episode **Donut Baker** is [here][4].

## Misc.

* [Docker on Windows Subsystem for Linux using VirtualBox and Docker Machine][5]. This post by [Travis Illig][travisi] discusses how you can enable both **VirtualBox** as well as **Docker for Windows** on the same Windows box.

## Microsoft Ignite

So, **Microsoft Ignite** starts tomorrow (September 24). It looks to be an awesome conference with lots and lots of announcements of new "stuff", I for one cannot wait!

If you, like me, are not attending but still want to follow the key-notes and various sessions, [this link][6] takes you to the live stream.

The other day I looked at the sessions and here are some that interests me:

* [BRK2416 - The roadmap for SQL Server](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/65955?source=sessions)
* [BRK2183 - SQL Server Machine Learning Services: An E2E platform for machine learning](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/65356?source=sessions)
* [BRK3228 - Whatâ€™s new in SQL Server on Linux and containers](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/65957?source=sessions)
* [BRK2229 - The future of SQL Server and big data](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/65956?source=sessions)
* [THR2168 - The next generation of SQL Server tools](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/66199?source=sessions)
* [BRK4021 - Deep dive on SQL Server and big data](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/65967?source=sessions)
* [THR2171 - Deploying a highly available SQL Server solution in Kubernetes](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/66202?source=sessions)
* [BRK3154 - SQL Server in containers for application development and DevOps](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/64634?source=sessions)
* [THR2308 - SQL Server vNext meets AI and Big Data](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/66961?source=sessions)

As you see, mostly SQL Server related sessions, and I must say that the sessions around SQL Server and Big Data intrigues me.

## Data Science

* [How Machine Learning Works: 3 Resources To Learn And Develop ML Applications][7]. The [Lightbend][8] team has put together some resources about how to design, build, run and manage machine learning applications in production.
* [Simplify Market Basket Analysis using FP-growth on Databricks][9]. In retail, you want to recommend to shoppers what to purchase, and often you base the recommendations on items that are frequently purchased together. A key technique to uncover associations between different items is known as market basket analysis. This blog post talks about how you run your market basket analysis using **Apache Spark MLlib** `FP-growth` algorithm on **Databricks**.
* [Introduction to Deep Learning][10]. This blog post is the first in a series about **Deep Learning**. At a quick glance, the series looks very informative.

## SQL Server Machine Learning Services

I am still working on the third post in the [Install R Packages in SQL Server ML Services](/series/sql_server_ml_services_install_packages) series. I hope to be able to publish it soon:ish.

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
