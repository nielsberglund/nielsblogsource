This post is more as a reminder to myself where to find online resources when learning F#. If anyone else can find it useful, so much better. And, if anyone out there has other online, resources, please leave a comment and I will include it. So, in no particular order:

* [Introductory article by Luke Hoban in MSDN Magazine.][LukeHobanMSDN]
* [An online book about F#.][CtoCornerF#]
* [Tutorial, by Dejan Jelovic, about getting started with F# from a C# developers perspective.][F#Tutorial]
* [Brian McNamara has great info and resource list, highly recommended.][BrianMc]

Finally, a list like this would be incomplete without the link to [the Man himself: **Don Syme**][DSyme]
