Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

## Streaming

* [Kafka Acks Explained][1]. The post here covers in detail how acks in Kafka works, and what the two config options `acks` and `min.insync.replicas` does. Very informative! 
* [Confluent Cloud KSQL is Now Available][2]. Finally! The post title says it all. KSQL and ksqlDB are now generally available in Confluent Cloud. That is so cool!
* [Preventing Fraud and Fighting Account Takeovers with Kafka Streams][3]. This is an awesome post, looking at how Kafka streams can be used in a fraud preventing scenario. Quite a lot of useful ideas in the post!
* [Inca â€” Message Tracing and Loss Detection For Streaming Data @Netflix][4]. I don't know how I have not seen this post earlier. Well, anyway, the post gives a good overview of how Netflix does message loss detection and tracing of their streaming events.

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

Had a nice Easter dinner yesterday - Happy Easter, everyone!

Still in lock-down. The lock-down period here in SA was a couple of days ago extended to the end of April! Let's hope the lock-down has an\ positive impact!  

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me. Most importantly, stay safe out there!
