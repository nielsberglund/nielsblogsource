Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## SQL Server

* [Announcing mssql-cli is now generally available on macOS and Linux][1]. `mssql-cli` is an open-source and cross-platform command-line tool to manage SQL Server on-prem and on the cloud. It has some cool features such as Intellisense and syntax highlighting. The blog post linked to here announces, among other things, the availability of `mssql-cli` on Linux and Mac. I have used it a bit, and it is quite awesome!

## .NET

* [High Five with .NET 5][2]. This post looks at the upcoming .NET 5 - the successor to .NET Core - and some of the features it brings.

## Domain Driven Design

* [DDD for microservices][3]. The post linked to here is the first post in a series where the author his experience adopting Domain-Driven Design and integrating it into the software development process. This particular post gives an introduction to DDD. I, for one, am looking forward to the upcoming posts.

## Big Data

* [Data Lake â€” Design For Better Architecture, Storage, Security & Data Governance][4]. This post discusses architecture patterns to follow when designing and building data lakes. Keep your eyes open for follow-up posts looking at practical approaches.
* [Hadoop Distributed File System][5]. I found this post to be an excellent guide helping me understand a bit more about the Hadoop File System, (HDFS). Highly recommended!
* [Monitoring Data Quality at Scale with Statistical Modeling][6]. If you base business decisions on data, you cannot have bad data. This post looks at how Uber monitors data quality by using statistical modelling. I found the post very interesting!
* [Apache YARN & Zookeeper][7]. This post dives down into the components that help with resource allocation and high availability in Hadoop: YARN and Zookeeper.

## Streaming

* [Highly Available, Fault-Tolerant Pull Queries in ksqlDB][8]. This, very informative, blog post looks at how ksqlDB pull queries can be highly available even during server failures.
* [Using Docker to test your Kafka applications][9]. A very cool post looking at how one can use a Java library, `testcontainers-java`, to run integration tests for Kafka based applications. 
* [Is Apache Kafka a Database?][10]. This is a thought-provoking article looking at if Kafka can be considered a database. My thoughts around that are - it depends. It depends on what functionality you expect a database to have. So, to me, I'd say Kafka is close, really close, but I would like to see the ability to do range queries against some other field(s) than the `ROWKEY` field before I consider Kafka a database.

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
