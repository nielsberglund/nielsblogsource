Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth that has to do with things that interest me:

* AI/data science
* data in general
* data architecture
* streaming
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Big Data

* [Get to Know Your Queries With the New Databricks SQL Query Profile!][1]. This blog post is part of a series on Databricks SQL that covers critical capabilities across performance, ease of use, and governance. This post takes a closer look at the new Databricks SQL Query Profile feature and how it helps data teams speed up and optimize their queries.

## AI

* [Microsoft goes public with details on its 'Singularity' AI infrastructure service][2]. A week or so ago, it was revealed how Microsoft's Azure and Research teams are working together to build a new AI infrastructure service, codenamed "Singularity". The post linked to looks at what this could be and looks back at previous projects with the same codename. Interesting!

## Streaming

* [Building Real-Time Data Systems the Hard Way][3]. This post compares the effort of building an event-driven system based on a relational database with building it using Kafka. Since the post is from Confluent, it is obvious what is the better choice. Anyway, it is an interesting post in that it covers real-world problems we run into when wanting to develop event-driven/real-time applications.

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

Nothing has changed from last week, so: prepping, prepping, prepping:

**Figure 1:** *Sessions at SQLBits 2022*

**SQLBits 2022** is very close now, and I am nowhere near ready to present the sessions you see in *Figure 1*, \<sigh\>! However, somehow everything will be OK! Details of the sessions:

* [**A Day of Azure Data Explorer**][6]. Full day training class.
* [**ksqlDB - The Real-Time Streaming Database**][7]. Conference session.
* [**Analyze Billions of Rows of Data in Real-Time Using Azure Data Explorer**][8]. Conference session.

There are still seats available for my training class as well as the conference. You register [here][9]!

See you in London in a bit over one week!

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. Please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me if you have ideas for what to cover.
