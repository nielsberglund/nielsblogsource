Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, etc., that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This is the "roundup" of the posts that has been most interesting to me, this week.

Hmm, this week there has not been much catching my eye. What has been is mostly data science / analytics related. Anyway, here we go.

## Data Science

* [LearnAnalytics@MS][1]. A Microsoft website which contains a lot of really cool resources if you want to learn about data science and analytics.
* [Backyard Data Science][2]. I came across this site from a link from the [site above][1]. This site by Buck Woody from Microsoft contains a lot of absolutely awesome articles related to data science.
* [The InfoQ eMag: Getting a Handle on Data Science][3]. From [InfoQ] an eMag looking at data science from the ground up, across technology selection, assembling raw and unstructured data, statistical thinking, machine learning basics, etc., etc.
* [Awesome - Most Cited Deep Learning Papers][4]. A curated list of the most cited deep learning papers since 2012. A lot of really interesting papers in there.
* [Machine Learning is Fun!][5]. A multi part guide to machine learning. It provides you with a high-level explanation of what machine learning is, and doing it in an easily understandable manner.
* [Optimisation and training techniques for deep learning][6]. Adrian Colyer from [the morning paper][mp] has waded through the [papers mentioned above][4] pertaining to "optimisation and training techniques". I believe I have mentioned it before, but I'll do it again: [the morning paper][mp] is an excellent source for data science related "stuff".
* [Microsoft SQL Server 2016 R Services Installation][7]. A post from yours truly. The post is the first in a series of posts about Microsoft SQL Server R Services. In this post I cover installation and enabling of SQL Server R Services.

## Big Data & Databases

* [Google Launches Cloud Spanner Public Beta][9]. In my [weekly roundup for week 7][9] I had a link to an article of [Spanner][10], the Google database that can span multiple geo-locations and still be seen as one instance. This article from [InfoQ][iq] talks about how Spanner has gone into public beta.

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
