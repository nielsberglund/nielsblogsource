Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Big Data

* [Helios: hyperscale indexing for the cloud & edge â€“ part 1][1]. In this post [Adrian][adcol] from the [morning paper][mp] dissects a white-paper about Helios. Helios is a distributed, highly-scalable system used at Microsoft for flexible ingestion, indexing, and aggregation of large streams of real-time data that is designed to plug into relational engines. Adrian is as thorough as usual, and the conclusions he draws are very interesting. I can't wait for part 2.

## Distributed Systems

* [How I am learning distributed systems][2]. This post looks, from one person's perspective, how one can learn to design distributed systems. What is interesting in this post is the use of [Raft][3], (no, not Raft the game - but the consensus algorithm), as a learning tool. I will definitely point to this post as a learning resource for my developers.
* [NGINX Steps into the Service Mesh Fray Promising a Simpler Alternative][4]. The post linked to here points discusses how NGINX introduces its own service mesh: [NGINX Service Mesh][5], (NSM). It promises to be less complicated than ISTIO, so I will definitely have a look.

## Streaming

* [Preparing Your Clients and Tools for KIP-500: ZooKeeper Removal from Apache Kafka][6]. The Kafka community has for quite a while been talking about removing the dependency of ZooKeeper, (ZK), from Kafka, and it seems we are getting closer. In the post I have linked to here, the author looks at what is needed to do in Kafka consumers so that nothing "bad" happens when ZK is eventually removed.
* [Streaming Machine Learning with Kafka-native Model Deployment][7]. Kafka is used more and more for real-time machine learning purposes, and we are moving towards Kafka as a native streaming model server. This blog post explores the architectures and trade-offs between various options for model deployment with Kafka.

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
