Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Misc.

* [How You Should Read Research Papers According To Andrew Ng (Stanford Deep Learning Lectures)][1]. This post looks at how to approach knowledge acquisition through published research papers. Very interesting!
* [Cuda on WSL2 for Deep Learning â€” First Impressions and Benchmarks][2]. A cool post about running CUDA on WSL2. This is something I need to check out!

## Domain Driven Design

* [Building Domain Driven Microservices][3]. This blog post covers various concepts, strategies, and design heuristics to consider when you go into the world of microservices. More specifically when you to break a monolith into multiple domain-based microservices. 

## Streaming

* [Kafka, for your data pipeline? Why not?][4]. The post here looks at how you can create a streaming data pipeline using Docker, Kafka, and Kafka Connect. Very cool!
* [Project Metamorphosis Month 3: Infinite Storage in Confluent Cloud for Apache Kafka][5]. This post discusses how Confluent is working towards limitless storage for Confluent Cloud. This looks very interesting, now if this could come for Kafka on-prem as well!

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

Wow! We are already in July - where has the first part of the year gone? Let's hope that the rest of the year will be better than the first half!

So, in last week's [roundup][7], I wrote these are nervous times right now, as it is MVP renewal time. The renewals should happen Wednesday, July 1st. I can say I was not that productive that day, as I mostly refreshed my email client to see whether there was an email saying if I were renewed or not. 

The day dragged on, and I heard from some of my fellow MVP's how they had received their renewal emails - that did not make me feel any better, and then I received this:

**Figure 1:** *MVP Renewal*

Phew, I am renewed for another year. Thank you, Microsoft!

Ok, enough about that. This week on Tuesday, (July 7th), the Azure User Group here in Durban have our monthly *News and Catchup* meeting. If you want to come and hang out, (virtually), the link is [here][6]. See you Tuesday!

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
