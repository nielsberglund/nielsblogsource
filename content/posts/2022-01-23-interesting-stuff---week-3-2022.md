Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth that has to do with things that interest me:

* AI/data science
* data in general
* data architecture
* streaming
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Databases

* [CIDR 2022 Conference][2]. The Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) is a systems-oriented conference emphasizing the systems architecture perspective. CIDR 2022 was held a couple of weeks ago, and the link is to the table of content, which has links to the given talks. There are some very interesting presentations there.
* [Trip.comï¼šStarRocks efficiently supports high concurrent queries, dramatically reduces labor and hardware cost][3]. The last few years have seen an emergence of real-time distributed OLAP datastore's; Druid, Apache Pinot, Clickhouse, etc. The link here is a post about StarRocks, a fairly new entry into the market. The post compares StarRocks with ClickHouse, and StarRocks comes out quite favourable.

## Streaming

* [Announcing the Confluent Q1 '22 Launch][4]. This blog post announces new features for Confluent Cloud being launched in Q1 2022. One new "feature" that I like is the new Confluent CLI `confluent v2`. With `confluent v2`, I no longer need separate CLI's for on-prem and cloud!
* [Introduction to Streaming Data Pipelines with Apache Kafka and ksqlDB][5]. This blog post describes the elements involved in setting up a Kafka-based data pipeline: connecting data entities together; streaming data from source(s) into the middle of the pipeline; filtering, joining, and enriching the data with ksqlDB. Cool stuff! 

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

If you read my [roundup from week 49 last year][6], you do know:

**Figure 1:** *SQLBITS 2022 - A Day of Azure Data Explorer*

Yes, I am presenting a one-day training class about Azure Data Explorer at SQLBits 2022. Referring back to what I am doing, I did a promo video for my class last evening, so go to [**A Day of Azure Data Explorer**][1] and have a look. Then [**register**][7] for [**SQLBits 2022**][7].

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. Please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me if you have ideas for what to cover.
