Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Misc.

* [Microsoft Build 2020: Highlights][1]. A couple of weeks ago Microsoft held its annual developer conference, Build. Due to the pandemic, it was a virtual 48 hour, around the clock conference, and it was free. The article linked to here is an [InfoQ][iq] article listing noteworthy "stuff" from the conference. As a side note: I wonder how much changes we will see in the conference landscape after when this pandemic is over. Will there be "on-prem" conferences any more, or will most conferences go virtual? 

## Big Data

* [Apache Arrow and Java: Lightning Speed Big Data Transfer][2]. So Apache Arrow is a cross-language, cross-platform, columnar in-memory data format for data. The [InfoQ][iq] article linked to here introduces Apache Arrow and gets you acquainted with the basic concepts of the Apache Arrow Java library. If you're not a Java developer, don't worry - Apache Arrow offers libraries for many other languages as well: C, C++, C#, Go, to name a few.

## Machine Learning

* [Modernizing Risk Management Part 1: Streaming data-ingestion, rapid model development and Monte-Carlo Simulations at Scale][3]. This blog post demonstrates how to modernize traditional value-at-risk (VaR) calculation. It is demonstrated in the post, by using various components of the Databricks Unified Data Analytics Platform â€” Delta Lake, Apache SparkTM and MLflow. This enables a more agile and forward-looking approach to risk management.

## Streaming

* [Building a Clickstream Dashboard Application with ksqlDB and Elasticsearch][4]. This post shows an example of how you can build an event-driven application to help you unlock insights contained in the event streams of your business. As the title implies, Kafka, ksqlDB, and Elasticsearch are the components used. Very cool post!
* [Best Practices to Secure Your Apache Kafka Deployment][5]. So you are building your event streaming platform on Kafka - awesome! When you are ready to go live, your "pesky" security department asks you about security: "how is the data that flows through Kafka secure, what have you done to prevent data breaches?". Trust me, they will ask you! Fear not, the post I link to here reviews five security categories and the essential features of Kafka and Confluent Platform that enable you to secure your event streaming platform. If you work with Kafka, **READ** the post!
* [Derivco Webinar - Kafka Masterclass][6]. As I mentioned in last weeks roundup, [Charl Lamprecht][charl], and I were going to do a [Derivco](/derivco) Webinar about Kafka: **Conquer Your Data with Kafka and ksqlDB**. Well, we did it, and the link here is to the uploaded YouTube video. Both [Charl][charl] and I had a blast, and we believe the webinar was a success - peak attendance was at around 700 attendees

## WIND (What Is Niels Doing)

Still lockdown! Apparently, some of the lockdown restrictions will be eased June 1, but I don't see me being back in the office for at least a month, most likely two.

As I mentioned above, I did the [Derivco](/derivco) Kafka [webinar][6] last week together with [Charl][charl], and we had a great time.

I am still working on the follow-up to the [**A Lap Around SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster: Background & Technology**][9] post. The upcoming post looks at the architecture. So when will it be published you may ask? I have learnt from my mistakes, so at this stage, I have no idea.

Our local [Azure Meetup group][7] has a virtual catchup on Tuesday, (June 1), where we discuss any news or anything interesting that came out in May 2020 in the industry. If you are interested, please register [here][8].

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
