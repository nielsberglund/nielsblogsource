Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth, that has to do with things that interest me:

* data science
* data in general
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me, for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## SQL Server

* [SQL Server 2017 on Linux webcast series][1]. I guess that anyone interested in SQL Server knows about SQL Server on Linux. This blog-post announces a series of webcasts covering SQL Server on Linux.
* [Simplify data access using de-normalized models][2]. A very interesting post by [Jovan][jovpop] how to use JSON to de-normalise database models.

## .NET

* [Resources for Learning about .NET Internals][3]. [Matthew][mattw] posts some very awesome links if you want to learn about .NET internals!

## Misc.

* [A practitionerâ€™s guide to reading programming languages papers][6]. A "cheat-sheet" from [Adrian][adcol] about how to read programming language white-papers.

## Data Science

* [Data Science Virtual Machine][4]. This is the first episode of the AI Show from [Channel9][5] talking about the Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM).
* [How to build your own AlphaZero AI using Python and Keras][7]. In the [week 2 roundup][int2] I linked to a post about AlphaZero, the AI application from [DeepMind][8], who teaches itself to play multiple board-games, like GO, chess, etc. In this post, David Foster - from Applied Data Science - shows how you can build something similar with Python and Keras. Very cool!!

## Streaming

* [Streaming Data in the Enterprise Hits a Tipping Point: Our 2018 Predictions][9]. Prediction from dataArtisans about the streaming and streaming technologies in 2018.
* [Managing Large State in Apache Flink: An Intro to Incremental Checkpointing][10]. An introduction to check-pointing, which is the mechanism Apache Flink uses to make application state fault tolerant. Extremely interesting!

## SQL Server R Services

I am busy finishing off the last post about SQL Server R Services internals: **Internals - XX**, and I hope to be able to publish it this coming week sometime. After the *Internals - XX*, there will be one or two more posts in the series, but then I am done.

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. If you have ideas for what to cover, please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me.
