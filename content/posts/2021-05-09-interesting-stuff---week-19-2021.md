Throughout the week, I read a lot of blog-posts, articles, and so forth that has to do with things that interest me:

* AI/data science
* data in general
* data architecture
* streaming
* distributed computing
* SQL Server
* transactions (both db as well as non db)
* and other "stuff"

This blog-post is the "roundup" of the things that have been most interesting to me for the week just ending.

<!--more-->

## Machine Learning

* [Optimal Feature Discovery: Better, Leaner Machine Learning Models Through Information Theory][1]. This post talks about an approach at Uber called Optimal Feature Discovery. It searches for the most compact set of features out of all available at Uber for a given model, both boosting accuracy and reducing feature count at the same time.  

## Databases

* [Why a Serverless Data API Might be Your Next Database][2]. This [InfoQ][iq] article discusses database as a service (DBaaS) and serverless data API for cloud-based data management.

## Streaming

* [EDA implementation â€” Integration scenarios][3]. The post linked to is a follow up to [Applying Event-Driven Architecture in Digital Transformation Projects][4], which discussed a generic architecture for event-driven architecture (EDA) based systems. This post explores implementation approaches for such event-driven systems by focusing on specific products and their interactions.
* [Streaming ETL with Confluent: Routing and Fan-Out of Apache Kafka Messages with ksqlDB][5]. This post looks at how we can use ksqlDB for message routing. I quite liked the post, and I will definitely see if we can implement some of this at [Derivco](/derivco).

## ~ Finally

That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy what I did put together. Please comment on this post or [ping][ma] me if you have ideas for what to cover.
