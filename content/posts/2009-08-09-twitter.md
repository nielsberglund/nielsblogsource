As the saying goes; "It is hard to learn an old dog new tricks", but...Â  Even though I am a really old dog, I hope I'll be able to learn a bit about "social networking", and therefore I created an account on Twitter a couple of days ago. Hopefully I'll be able to be more active on Twitter than what I've been here at the blog. Well, that should not be too hard, seeing how infrequent I post here.

Anyway, my twitter account is [**@nielsberglund**][1], so if you are interested you know where to go.
