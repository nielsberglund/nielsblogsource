### Niels Berglund - Hang√∂ pojke, SQL Server/ Data/.NET nerd

I work as a *Software Architect* at [**Derivco**](/derivco) in [Durban SA][1], and I am a Microsoft Data Platform MVP (Most Valuable Professional). My job is to safeguard and evolve our architecture as well as to design completely new architectures by using the latest technologies in innovative ways. I love it!! Before joining Derivco I worked for Developmentor as a researcher / instructor, where I was responsible for the database curriculum.

Having worked with SQL Server since it shared codebase with Sybase, my main technology interest is databases in general and SQL Server specifically. I am also very interested in message based applications, distributed and concurrent systems. Recently Data Science has caught my eye, and I am doing quite a lot of work with the various Microsoft R technologies.
