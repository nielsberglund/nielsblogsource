# About Me

I am a Microsoft Data Platform MVP, and I work as a Software Architect Lead at [Derivco](/derivco) in Durban, South Africa. Me and the architects in my team design and develop highly performant iGaming systems.

Before joining Derivco, I worked as a researcher/instructor at Developmentor, responsible for the database curriculum.

I have been been working with SQL Server since SQL Server 4.2 and co-authored the first SQL Server 2005 book for developers: "A First Look at SQL 2005 for Developers". Apart from being a SQL Server "nerd", I am now interested in real-time streaming data, stream processing, and the Cloud and Big Data.

I quite often give conference talks at technology conferences such as: Tech-Ed (RIP), SQL PASS, DevWeek, SQL Bits, SQL Saturday, etc.
