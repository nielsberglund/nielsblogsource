Welcome back to our Claude Code development series! Today, we're taking a crucial step that separates successful projects from failed ones: comprehensive system planning and architectural design. Rather than rushing into implementation, we'll use Claude Code's powerful analytical capabilities to design a robust, scalable event management system from the ground up.

* To see all the posts in the series, go to: [**Building an Event Management System with Claude Code**](/contact-event-claude-code).

At Derivco, we've learned that the most expensive bugs are architectural decisions made too early without proper analysis. Claude Code's analytical capabilities have revolutionized how we approach this critical planning phase, turning what used to be weeks of meetings and documentation into focused, AI-assisted strategic sessions that produce better results in less time.

## Recap: Part 2 Accomplishments

Before we dive into planning our new system, let's quickly review the key milestones we achieved in Part 2:

üîó **IDE Integration Mastery**: We successfully integrated Claude Code with VSCode, including WSL setup for Windows users, transforming our development experience from terminal-based interactions to seamless in-editor AI assistance.

üìù **CLAUDE.md Discovery**: We discovered and implemented the powerful CLAUDE.md file using the `/init` command, learning how this serves as a centralised knowledge base that gives Claude Code a comprehensive understanding of our projects.

üß≠ **Context-Aware Development**: We experienced firsthand how Claude Code's understanding of entire project structures enables more intelligent suggestions that align with existing code patterns and architectural decisions.

üíª **Practical Implementation**: We successfully used Claude Code to analyze codebases, plan new functionality, and implement working API endpoints, demonstrating the power of AI-assisted development workflows.

‚ö° **Advanced Techniques**: We learned to use specific prompting techniques like `think` commands to encourage thoughtful analysis rather than immediate code generation, giving us better control over the development process.

Now that we have these foundational skills with Claude Code, we're ready to tackle something much more ambitious: designing and building a complete event management system from scratch.

## Starting Fresh: Why We're Building Anew

For this next phase of our journey, we're going to start with a clean slate. While our previous `Node.js` application served as an excellent learning platform for Claude Code basics, building a production-ready event management system requires a more thoughtful approach from the ground up.

Starting fresh allows us to:

* **Apply Best Practices from Day One**: Implement proper architecture, testing, and deployment strategies from the beginning
* **Use Modern Technology Stack**: Take advantage of the latest tools and frameworks that are best suited for our specific requirements
* **Design for Scale**: Build with growth and maintainability in mind rather than retrofitting onto a simple prototype
* **Implement Security Properly**: Integrate authentication, authorisation, and data protection from the foundation up
* **Plan for Integration**: Design APIs and data structures that will work seamlessly with external services and future enhancements

This approach demonstrates how Claude Code excels not just at extending existing code but at helping you make strategic decisions for greenfield projects.

## Why Planning Matters More Than Ever

Before we write a single line of code, we need to step back and think strategically. Building a production-ready event management system that can replace Brevo for [**Data & AI Community Day Durban**][dataai] events requires careful planning across multiple dimensions:

* **Functional Requirements**: What exactly do we need the system to do?
* **Technical Architecture**: How do we build it to scale and maintain?
* **Integration Strategy**: How does it connect with existing tools and workflows?
* **User Experience**: How do we make it better than what we're replacing?
* **Future Flexibility**: How do we ensure it can evolve with our needs?

The beauty of using Claude Code for planning is that it brings analytical rigour to these decisions while maintaining the iterative, collaborative approach we've grown to love in the coding process.

## Understanding Our Requirements with Claude Code

The first step in any successful project is understanding what we're actually trying to accomplish. Let's leverage Claude Code's analytical capabilities to perform a comprehensive requirements analysis.

However, before we do that, let us create a project directory.

### Project Directory

In the past episodes, we have been working in the `claude-test` directory. For this new project, let's create a dedicated directory structure to keep things organised.

Create a new directory for the event management system:

```bash
mkdir event-management-system
cd event-management-system
```
<figcaption><br><b>Code Snippet 1:</b><em>Create Project Directory</em></br></figcaption>

If you are on macOS, you just execute the code in *Code Snippet 1* in your terminal. If you are on Windows and WSL, you open your distribution terminal and execute the code.

Once this is done, open your IDE in this directory and proceed with the requirements analysis mentioned above.

### Analyzing Current Pain Points

Open your Claude Code shell in VSCode and let's start with understanding what we're trying to replace:

``` bash
Analyze and think about the typical functionality provided by event management 
platforms like Brevo for organizing tech conferences. Think about what 
features would be essential for managing "Data & AI Community Day Durban" 
events, including speaker management, participant registration, communication 
workflows, and reporting. Keep in mind that the creation of an event and 
registration of speakers happens through a third party system: Sessionize. 
Participant registration also happens via a third party system: Quicket. 
What are the key pain points that a custom solution could address better than generic platforms?
```
