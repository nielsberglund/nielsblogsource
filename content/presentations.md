## SQL Saturday, 2019

* [A Lap Around SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster](/download/s2k19-bdc-overview.pdf): The new release of SQL Server; SQL Server 2019 includes Apache Spark and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for scalable compute and storage. This new architecture that combines together the SQL Server database engine, Spark, and HDFS into a unified data platform is called a “big data cluster.”
This session gives you an overview of what a SQL Server Big Data Cluster is, and what you can do with it.
* [What is the PiRate, Snake, and Cup of Coffee Doing in My Database?](/download/pirate-snake-coffee.pdf): In this session we look at the SQL Server Extensibility Framework, and we see how we can call out to external languages from inside SQL Server. We look at R, Python and Java, and what we can do from SQL Server having access to those languages.
