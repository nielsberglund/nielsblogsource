New post: "Interesting Stuff - Week 40, 2022"

Interesting things during the week just gone:

* I was quite into the external tables in SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster. The new PolyBase in SQL Server 2022, now inherits all that cool functionality.
* I found a downloadable eMag book discussing modern data architectures. The part about Real-Time Machine Learning was very, very cool, especially since I have "dabbled" in that a bit (look out for a blogpost in the near future).
* Oooh, visual stream designer for Kafka. I sooo want it!
* Kafka 3.3 released. The biggie in this release is KRaft!
* I am doing a presentation about ingestion in Azure Data Explorer at Durban's Azure Usergroup!

New post: "Interesting Stuff - Week 39, 2022".

Things I picked up this week:

* Very cool article around distributed systems design. The article led to links to other posts around the same topic. Very interesting, and I am sharing those links with people at @Derivco.
* It wouldn't be a weekly roundup without something related to Azure Data Explorer. This time it is a link how to set up the ADX Kafka sink connector to ingest Protobuf data into ADX. Cool!
* We are all using Confluent Cloud, yes?! I linked to an article about the new Terraform provider for Confluent Cloud.
* Dunith Dhanushka wrote an excellent post comparing stateful stream processing and streaming databases. Well worth a read!
* Another link around stream processing. This one is a post by Gary Stafford and it compares various stream processing technologies. The post is absolutely awesome!

If the above sounds interesting, hit the link to my roundup post at:

Some interesting things this week:

* Churn predictions in Apache Spark
* What is a Confusion Matrix, and how to create one in Python. So, note to self - a confusion matrix is not called Confusion Matrix becuase you become confused trying to interpret it!
* A very cool visualization of the Raft consensus protocol.
* Thoughtworks compendium around Distributed Systems is done!
* Learn Azure Data Explorer via MS Learn!
* Databases, Kafka Connect, JDBC and CDC. Cool stuff!
* Even cooler - awesome functionality in the Kafka Extension for Azure Functions!
* Niels doing an Azure Data Explorer presentation at Durban's Azure Usergroup!

Some more stuff caught my eye this week compared to last:

* Useful Python extensions for VSCode.
* How the Kusto (KQL) language in Azure Data Explorer makes it easier to format date-time.
* Speaking of Kusto, they have just opened a detective agency, and you can apply!
* Apache Spark and serving MLLib models.
* Robin Moffat (Mr Kafka) looks at data engineering. Must read!
* Kafka, ksqlDB and iGaming. Very cool!
* Finally, just pointing out to Lee-Anne that I present at Data Platform Summit 2022 :)

New post: "Interesting Stuff - Week 36, 2022".

It is interesting how some weeks you have quite a few interesting links for the weekly roundup, and other weeks just a few. This week it is definitely the latter:

* Some "cool stuff" from Microsoft Research related to reinforcement learning.
* Microsoft has just released a Docker image for the @Azure Data Explorer's query engine endpoint. How cool is that?!
* It just to be that if you wanted to write KStreams applications you had to use Java/Scala. Nothing wrong with that, but I am a .NET guy myself. , so i was very happy to hear about an Open Source project of KStreams for .NET!
* #DataPlatformVirtualSummit2022 is just around the corner and I present a session there!

Another Sunday, another "what's been interesting" post. Some "stuff" in this post:

 * Microsoft's Dev Box is in public preview. Dev Box is a managed service that enables developers to create on-demand, high-performance, secure, ready-to-code, project-specific workstations in the cloud. Sounds awesome!
* I really like @Azure Data Explorer's Web UI. I link to a post discussing new features in the August 2022 release.
* Using AI to find papers/articles about AI. Hmm, is that a circular reference? Anyway, a link to an article about some new AI-supported search/query software.
* Kafka and KRaft. Link to resources for learning about KRaft, Kafka's ZooKeeper replacement.

So, what is today's post bringing:

* Kafka and streaming ML.
* Do data pipelines the easy way: declarative.
* I don't know why you would have data in Amazon S3, but if you do - here's what to do to ingest into Azure Data Explorer from Amazon S3, and other interesting topics!

Another Sunday, another post with links to "stuff" I find interesting:

* You probably know that I am a big fan of Azure Data Explorer, but the link to benchmarks for ADX compared to Big Query and Snowflake blew my mind.
* Kafka, and Kafka triggers for Azure Serverless functions. Very cool - we actually use them for a very cool project here at Derivco.
* Is Kafka only for big data analytics, and not transactional workloads? Check out the link in my post.

New post: "Interesting Stuff - Week 32, 2022".

Time for my weekly "roundup" post where I link to:

* How to ingest Protobuf data from Kafka into Azure Data Explorer. Very cool
* More about Kafka; ingest data from Kafka into Databricks Delta Live tables.
* SynapseML does now have .NET APIs, and how to build scalable and intelligent systems for solving challenges using these new APIs.
* Microsoft has released a free AI course. Looks very interesting!
* Very cool about Kafka and serverless stream processing using Azure functions!

New post: "Interesting Stuff - Week 31, 2022".

Time for my weekly "roundup" post where I link to:

* For the peeps interested in Deep Learning a post with links to some very cool white-papers about some of the newer fundamentals in the Deep Learning space.
* The second post in a series about using Kafka and Confluent Cloud for modernizing databases.
* A post in a series how to build a Data Mesh using Azure technologies.
* Netflix Data Mesh, which is not a Data Mesh - but still a Data Mesh. Confusing, I know!

New post: "Interesting Stuff - Week 30, 2022".

In this weekly post, I link to:

* The "battle" between Databricks and Snowflake to see who will be the "king" of the Enterprise Data Cloud.
* An awesome article about Kafka and CI/CD. If you do Kafka, you should definitely read it.
* A post by Kai Waehner about how and why Kafka is a must for the data mesh.
* A book about Azure Data Explorer. Apart from being a great book, I wrote an editorial review of the book
