New post: "Interesting Stuff - Week 33, 2022".

Another Sunday, another post with links to "stuff" I find interesting:

* You probably know that I am a big fan of Azure Data Explorer, but the link to benchmarks for ADX compared to Big Query and Snowflake blew my mind.
* Kafka, and Kafka triggers for Azure Serverless functions. Very cool - we actually use them for a very cool project here at Derivco.
* Is Kafka only for big data analytics, and not transactional workloads? Check out the link in my post.

New post: "Interesting Stuff - Week 32, 2022".

Time for my weekly "roundup" post where I link to:

* How to ingest Protobuf data from Kafka into Azure Data Explorer. Very cool
* More about Kafka; ingest data from Kafka into Databricks Delta Live tables.
* SynapseML does now have .NET APIs, and how to build scalable and intelligent systems for solving challenges using these new APIs.
* Microsoft has released a free AI course. Looks very interesting!
* Very cool about Kafka and serverless stream processing using Azure functions!

New post: "Interesting Stuff - Week 31, 2022".

Time for my weekly "roundup" post where I link to:

* For the peeps interested in Deep Learning a post with links to some very cool white-papers about some of the newer fundamentals in the Deep Learning space.
* The second post in a series about using Kafka and Confluent Cloud for modernizing databases.
* A post in a series how to build a Data Mesh using Azure technologies.
* Netflix Data Mesh, which is not a Data Mesh - but still a Data Mesh. Confusing, I know!

New post: "Interesting Stuff - Week 30, 2022".

In this weekly post, I link to:

* The "battle" between Databricks and Snowflake to see who will be the "king" of the Enterprise Data Cloud.
* An awesome article about Kafka and CI/CD. If you do Kafka, you should definitely read it.
* A post by Kai Waehner about how and why Kafka is a must for the data mesh.
* A book about Azure Data Explorer. Apart from being a great book, I wrote an editorial review of the book
