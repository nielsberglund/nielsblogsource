New post: "Interesting Stuff - Week 35, 2022".

Another Sunday, another "what's been interesting" post. Some "stuff" in this post:

 * Microsoft's Dev Box is in public preview. Dev Box is a managed service that enables developers to create on-demand, high-performance, secure, ready-to-code, project-specific workstations in the cloud. Sounds awesome!
* I really like @Azure Data Explorer's Web UI. I link to a post discussing new features in the August 2022 release.
* Using AI to find papers/articles about AI. Hmm, is that a circular reference? Anyway, a link to an article about some new AI-supported search/query software.
* Kafka and KRaft. Link to resources for learning about KRaft, Kafka's ZooKeeper replacement.

So, what is today's post bringing:

* Kafka and streaming ML.
* Do data pipelines the easy way: declarative.
* I don't know why you would have data in Amazon S3, but if you do - here's what to do to ingest into Azure Data Explorer from Amazon S3, and other interesting topics!

Another Sunday, another post with links to "stuff" I find interesting:

* You probably know that I am a big fan of Azure Data Explorer, but the link to benchmarks for ADX compared to Big Query and Snowflake blew my mind.
* Kafka, and Kafka triggers for Azure Serverless functions. Very cool - we actually use them for a very cool project here at Derivco.
* Is Kafka only for big data analytics, and not transactional workloads? Check out the link in my post.

New post: "Interesting Stuff - Week 32, 2022".

Time for my weekly "roundup" post where I link to:

* How to ingest Protobuf data from Kafka into Azure Data Explorer. Very cool
* More about Kafka; ingest data from Kafka into Databricks Delta Live tables.
* SynapseML does now have .NET APIs, and how to build scalable and intelligent systems for solving challenges using these new APIs.
* Microsoft has released a free AI course. Looks very interesting!
* Very cool about Kafka and serverless stream processing using Azure functions!

New post: "Interesting Stuff - Week 31, 2022".

Time for my weekly "roundup" post where I link to:

* For the peeps interested in Deep Learning a post with links to some very cool white-papers about some of the newer fundamentals in the Deep Learning space.
* The second post in a series about using Kafka and Confluent Cloud for modernizing databases.
* A post in a series how to build a Data Mesh using Azure technologies.
* Netflix Data Mesh, which is not a Data Mesh - but still a Data Mesh. Confusing, I know!

New post: "Interesting Stuff - Week 30, 2022".

In this weekly post, I link to:

* The "battle" between Databricks and Snowflake to see who will be the "king" of the Enterprise Data Cloud.
* An awesome article about Kafka and CI/CD. If you do Kafka, you should definitely read it.
* A post by Kai Waehner about how and why Kafka is a must for the data mesh.
* A book about Azure Data Explorer. Apart from being a great book, I wrote an editorial review of the book
