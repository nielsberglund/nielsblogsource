New post: "Interesting Stuff - Week 31, 2022".

Time for my weekly "roundup" post where I link to:

* For the peeps interested in Deep Learning a post with links to some very cool white-papers about some of the newer fundamentals in the Deep Learning space.
* The second post in a series about using Kafka and Confluent Cloud for modernizing databases.
* A post in a series how to build a Data Mesh using Azure technologies.
* Netflix Data Mesh, which is not a Data Mesh - but still a Data Mesh. Confusing, I know!

New post: "Interesting Stuff - Week 30, 2022".

In this weekly post, I link to:

* The "battle" between Databricks and Snowflake to see who will be the "king" of the Enterprise Data Cloud.
* An awesome article about Kafka and CI/CD. If you do Kafka, you should definitely read it.
* A post by Kai Waehner about how and why Kafka is a must for the data mesh.
* A book about Azure Data Explorer. Apart from being a great book, I wrote an editorial review of the book
