When we discuss error messages, there are two main types of errors:

* Errors generated from the R script.
* Errors raised when generating the input data-set (`input_data_1`).

#### R Errors

We'll start with looking at R errors, and what happens when we have some code looking like so:

```sql title: "Error 1"
EXEC sp_execute_external_script
                 @language = N'R' ,
                 @script = N'Sys.sleep(10)
                             d <- 42
                             #the function below does not exist
                             nonExistFunc(d)';
```
**Code Snippet 13:** *Script with Missing Function*

As you see in *Code Snippet 13*, the script calls into a function: `nonExistFunc`, which doesn't exist. When executing the code, the output is something like this:

**Figure 9:** *R Script Error*

When looking at *Figure 9*, we see that there is a SQL Server error number assigned to the error, so somehow SQL must understand what the error is, but at the same time we see the message `could not find function "nonExistFunc"`. So some part of the message must come from R, and how does it get to SQL Server? The answer is that the behavior is as before -
